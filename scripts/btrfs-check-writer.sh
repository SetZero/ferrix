# Run host `btrfs check` over every volume the btrfs write path's tests write.
#
# `libs/btrfs-write` checks its own output with a consistency checker of its
# own and with the stage 11 reader. Neither is btrfs. This script is the
# third oracle: the ignored test `btrfs_check_images` writes each image the
# write path produces into a scratch directory, and `btrfs check` from
# btrfs-progs reads every one, data checksums included. Any error it reports,
# or a non-zero exit, fails the script.
#
# Needs btrfs-progs on PATH; refuses to run, rather than passing, without it.
#
# Also runs the power-fail test's host half at full size, which is too slow
# for every `cargo test`.
#
# Usage: scripts/btrfs-check-writer.sh
