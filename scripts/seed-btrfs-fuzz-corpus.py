"""Write the seed corpus for the `btrfs_read` fuzz target.

Each input is a selector byte and a list of edits to one of the real images in
`libs/btrfs/testdata/` (see `fuzz/fuzz_targets/btrfs_read.rs` for the layout).
The seeds are the untouched images, so the first run already mounts all four,
plus two resealed edits so a mutated-but-checksummed image is in the corpus
from the start rather than something the fuzzer has to stumble on.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/seed-btrfs-fuzz-corpus.py
