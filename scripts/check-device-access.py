"""Hold the seam: the kernel enumerates devices, and drives none.

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1 and §7 make a structural claim. Buses are enumerated
in the kernel, because that needs ACPI, a device tree and privileged access;
but the thing that pokes a device's registers lives in ring 3, behind an
`IoMapping` and an IOMMU domain. That claim is what makes a userspace driver
worth having -- and it is the kind of claim that decays one convenient access
at a time, each of which looked reasonable on its own.

So this is an allow-list, not a threshold, and it works like
`scripts/check-asm-budget.py`: adding a site is a deliberate act somebody had
to argue for in a diff.

What counts as a site
---------------------

Three different things wear the same spelling in Rust, and conflating them
would make this gate noise:

  register   A device register: memory-mapped I/O, or an x86 port. Reading one
             can have side effects -- reading a 16550's receive buffer consumes
             a character. These are what the seam is about, and an entry of
             this kind is refused outside the directories §1 and §7 permit.

  shared     Ordinary RAM that a device or another process also reads: an
             IOMMU's tables, a virtio configuration space, the block and net
             rings in their VMOs. Volatile because something outside this
             processor observes it, not because it is a register. Permitted
             anywhere an entry argues for it, since this is the ring protocol
             §7 is built on.

  memory     Ordinary RAM, volatile only so the compiler cannot elide an access
             the check is making on purpose: a poisoned page read back, a page
             table word, a stack walk. Nothing to do with devices at all.

The gate cannot tell the three apart by reading the source -- they are the same
call -- so the allow-list says which each file is, and the diff that adds one
is where that is argued. What the gate does enforce is that the claim was made
at all, that it stays inside its budget, and that a `register` entry sits only
where the architecture says a register may be touched.

Four rules:

  1. A file under `kernel/` containing a device access must be listed in
     `scripts/device-access-allowlist.json`, with a `kind` and a `reason`.
  2. Each entry declares a `max_sites` budget the file must stay under.
  3. A stale entry fails, the way `#[expect]` does: a file that no longer
     contains one must lose its exemption rather than keep it warm.
  4. A `register` entry must be under one of the permitted paths. This is the
     rule that carries the weight; the rest keep it honest.
