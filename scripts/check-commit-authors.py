"""Assert no commit carries a `Co-authored-by:` trailer.

Ferrix records one author per commit. `.githooks/commit-msg` refuses a trailer
when a message is written and `.githooks/pre-push` refuses it again over the
range being published, which the hooks' README describes as the rule being
"checked in two places rather than one".

It was not. Both places are hooks, and hooks only run when a clone has been
told where they live:

    git config core.hooksPath .githooks

That line is local configuration, it cannot be committed, and in this clone it
was never run. So neither hook had ever executed, `.git/hooks` held nothing but
Git's samples, and eight commits carrying the trailer were written and seven of
them pushed without a single check firing. Two places behind one un-committable
switch is one control with two names, not defence in depth.

This is the third place, and the only one that does not depend on anybody
remembering anything: CI runs it on the range a push or a pull request adds.

Two things are deliberately *not* matched, so the gate never teaches anyone to
reach for `--no-verify`:

  * the phrase inside a sentence -- only a trailer at the start of a line
    counts, which is why the commit that introduced the hooks may describe the
    rule in prose and still pass;
  * history that is already public -- the check runs over a range, never over
    the whole tree, so it reports what a change is adding and not what it
    inherited.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-commit-authors.py                  # unpushed commits
    python3 scripts/check-commit-authors.py BASE HEAD        # an explicit range
    python3 scripts/check-commit-authors.py --hooks          # is this clone armed?
