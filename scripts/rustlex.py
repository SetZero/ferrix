"""Tell Rust code from Rust comments and literals, for the gates that read it.

`check-item-boundary.py` and `check-complexity.py` both measure code, and both
used to find it with the same three regular expressions: `//.*$`, `/\\*.*?\\*/`
and `"(?:[^"\\\\]|\\\\.)*"`. Each is wrong on input the kernel contains:

  * the string pattern cannot cross a `\\`-newline continuation (its `.` does
    not match a newline), so it gives up at the first one and pairs the next
    `"` with the wrong partner -- from there to the end of the file code is
    string and string is code. `main.rs::say_booted` measured 102 lines
    (it has ten) and `register_load`, below it, was never found at all;
  * it starts a string at the `"` inside a char literal `'"'`;
  * block comments nest in Rust and the pattern stops at the first `*/`;
  * a `//` inside a string is not a comment, and a `"` inside a comment does
    not open a string -- but a pattern applied to the whole file cannot know
    which of the two it is inside.

The cure is to scan from the start of the file, deciding at each token start
what kind of token it is, the way the compiler does. That needs no parser: the
lexical grammar is small, and a function that gets it right is shorter than
the list of special cases the regular expressions were accumulating.

`mask(source)` returns the source with every comment blanked and every literal's
contents blanked, *same length, same newlines* -- so an offset into the mask is
an offset into the file, and a line number is a line number. Code is untouched,
lifetimes and labels included. `tokens(source)` splits the mask into what a
path resolver needs: identifiers, `::` and single punctuation.

Not handled, because the kernel has none and the self-test would say if it
grew some: `#[path]`-renamed modules (a gate question, asked in
check-item-boundary.py), and reserved-prefix syntax beyond `b`, `c`, `r`, `br`
and `cr`.
