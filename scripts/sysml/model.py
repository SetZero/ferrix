"""The parsed model: one element tree, plus the relations laid over it.

This is deliberately *not* a SysML v2 metamodel. A faithful one would need the
whole standard library and the whole type system, and the document this package
generates needs neither. What it needs is what the model actually writes down:
an element with a kind, a name, a maturity keyword, a stage, a doc comment, a
type, and children -- plus the handful of relations (`satisfy`, `verify`,
`allocate`, `dependency`) the roadmap and assurance packages draw between them.

So `Element` is one shape for every declaration, with the fields that are
absent left empty, and `Model` is the index over them. An element whose header
the parser did not recognise still lands here with its raw text intact and
`kind` left empty: the generator counts those and can fail on them, which is
how drift in the notation announces itself rather than silently dropping a
section from the document.

Names are qualified the way the model cites them -- `FerrixStructure::Kernel`
-- and every lookup and every iteration is sorted or insertion-ordered, because
the generated document has to be byte-identical for the same input.
