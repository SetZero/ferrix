"""Bound the complexity, length and recursion of the certified item.

EN 50716 requires a coding standard with metrics, and IEC 62304 §5.5.3 wants
unit verification against stated acceptance criteria. Eleven gates enforce
other properties of this tree -- every `unsafe` block documented, every panic
exemption justified, the assembly budget, the device-access seam, the crate
layering, the item boundary -- and none of them bounded how complicated a
single function may be. This is finding F-25.

Scope is the certified item as `scripts/certification-item.json` defines it:
the `core` and `item` rings, product code only. The uncertified load above them
carries no assurance claim and is measured but not enforced, so the numbers can
be compared.

Three measures
--------------

  complexity  Branch points plus one: `if`, `else if`, `match` arms, `while`,
              `for`, `loop`, `&&`, `||`, `?`. **This is an approximation.**
              Real cyclomatic complexity needs a parser and a control-flow
              graph; this counts tokens in comment-and-string-stripped source.
              It is stable, it is monotonic in the thing it approximates, and
              it is wrong in detail -- a `match` on an enum with twelve
              unreachable arms scores the same as twelve real branches.
              Stated here because a number whose caveats travel separately is
              worse than no number.

  lines       Statement lines in the body, blank and comment lines excluded.
              `clippy::too_many_lines` already denies over 100 crate-wide; this
              records the item's distribution so the cap can be ratcheted down
              rather than merely not exceeded.

  recursion   A function whose body names itself. Direct recursion only:
              mutual recursion through two functions, and any recursion through
              a trait object or a function pointer, are **not** detected. A
              kernel with no guard page under its stack has a real reason to
              care, so the limitation matters and is not hidden.

The ratchet
-----------

Like `scripts/check-item-boundary.py`: measure, record what exists, refuse
growth. `scripts/complexity-baseline.json` holds every function in the item
over a threshold, with its score. An entry may improve or disappear freely; a
new one, or an existing one getting worse, fails the build. Stale entries fail
too, so a simplified function cannot leave a permanent allowance behind.

    python3 scripts/check-complexity.py
    python3 scripts/check-complexity.py --report     # the distribution
    python3 scripts/check-complexity.py --record     # rewrite the baseline
