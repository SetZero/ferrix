"""Statement coverage for the kernel, measured from a QEMU boot.

`docs/sysml/11-assurance.sysml` records the reachability problem plainly: a
fuzzer cannot drive a page-fault handler and Miri cannot interpret a privileged
instruction, so `kernel/` is reachable only by booting it. That left the kernel
with no structural coverage measurement at all, which is the single largest
open objective for DO-178C DAL C (table A-7) and a recommended technique for
EN 50716 SIL 2.

This closes it without touching the toolchain. QEMU's `drcov` TCG plugin
records every basic block the guest translates and executes; the kernel's own
DWARF line table says which source statement each address belongs to. Intersect
the two and you have statement coverage of ring 0, per certification ring.

    cargo xtask test-boot --arch x86_64 --accel tcg   # with FERRIX_QEMU_PLUGIN
    python3 scripts/coverage-report.py \
        --drcov /tmp/ferrix-cov.drcov \
        --elf target/x86_64-unknown-none/debug/ferrix-kernel

What is being counted
---------------------

The denominator is every source line the compiler marked `is_stmt` in the DWARF
line table -- the line table's own notion of "a statement begins here", which is
what gcov-shaped tools count and the closest available analogue to the
statement coverage DAL C asks for. The numerator is those whose address fell
inside a basic block the boot executed.

Line 0 rows are compiler-generated and are not statements; they are skipped.

Two limitations, stated here rather than in a footnote, because a coverage
number people trust is worse than none if its caveats travel separately:

  * Coverage is of the profile actually booted. On an optimised build the line
    table is approximate -- inlining maps one address to several source lines,
    and a line with no instructions of its own cannot be reached. A DAL C
    submission has to either measure the configuration it ships or argue the
    mapping; this tool reports which profile it measured so the question
    cannot be quietly skipped.
  * A basic block that was translated and executed counts every statement
    inside it. That over-reports where a block was entered and left early by a
    trap. The effect is small and always in the optimistic direction, which is
    the direction worth declaring.

A suite, not one boot
---------------------

`--drcov` takes every trace of a suite and reports the union. Gates build
different kernels -- `test-shell` builds its program in, `test-vfs` its command
list -- so an address means a statement only in the build that ran it. A trace
`cargo xtask` wrote has a `<trace>.kernel` file beside it naming the ELF that
boot ran, and each trace is read against its own ELF, less its own KASLR
slide (`<trace>.slide`); a trace without a kernel file is read against
`--elf`. What is unioned is the *statement*, a source file and
line, and `--elf` alone says which statements there are to reach: the
denominator is the build that ships, and the other builds only say which of its
statements a test executed.

`cargo xtask coverage` runs the suite and calls this with `--floor`, the
ratchet: the certified item's share may not fall below the figure recorded for
the architecture in `docs/certification/coverage-floor.json`.
