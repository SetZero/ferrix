"""Hold the line on this project's founding constraint: it is written in Rust.

The goal is not "no assembly" -- an exception vector table, a syscall entry
trampoline and a context switch cannot be expressed in Rust, because each is
defined by what the *machine* does to registers before and after the first
instruction runs. The goal is that assembly appears only there, and that adding
a new assembly site is a deliberate act somebody had to argue for in a diff.

So this is an allow-list, not a threshold. Four rules:

  1. Assembly may only appear in a file listed in `scripts/asm-allowlist.json`,
     each entry carrying a `reason` for why Rust cannot express it.
  2. Each entry declares a `max_lines` budget the file must stay under, so a
     trampoline cannot quietly grow into a runtime.
  3. A stale entry fails, the way `#[expect]` does: a file that no longer
     contains assembly must lose its exemption rather than keep it warm for
     someone.
  4. The tree's total assembly, across every file, stays under
     `max_total_lines`.

Rule 4 is the one that carries the weight, and it is an *absolute* cap rather
than a percentage on purpose. A kernel's assembly is a fixed cost -- vectors,
syscall entry, context switch, the CPU primitives with no Rust spelling -- that
does not grow as the OS is built out. Capping it absolutely says exactly that:
this list is finished, and a scheduler or a filesystem must add none of it.

The Rust share is reported at every run alongside it, because that number is
the project's founding claim. Read it as a trend, not a gate: with assembly
held flat by rule 4, the percentage rises on its own as the system grows, and a
ratio ceiling that binds today would only be measuring how young the tree is.
`max_ratio` is a backstop set above where the tree sits now, ratcheted down as
it grows; `target_ratio` records where it is going.
