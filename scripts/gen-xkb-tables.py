"""Turn libxkbcommon's own keymaps into the tables the compositor's seat reads.

A `wl_keyboard` hands its client a keymap and then sends raw keycodes; the
client compiles the keymap with libxkbcommon and reads every letter out of it.
So the keymap has to be a real one, and the bits in `wl_keyboard.modifiers`
have to be the ones that keymap declares -- a modifier index is a property of
the keymap, not a constant.

`compositor/xkb/probe/keymap-*.txt` is what libxkbcommon says, one file a
layout, printed by a committed probe (`probe/keymap.c`, `probe/keymap.sh`) on
a host that has it. This turns each into two committed files: the keymap text
the compositor sends, and a Rust table of every key's name and its keysyms.

A layout the compositor does not ship is not a layout it can make up:
libxkbcommon compiles a keymap out of the XKB data files, which are tens of
megabytes of a desktop distribution and are not on a machine running Ferrix.
So the layouts are chosen here, generated on a host that has the data, and
committed.

None of it may be written by hand, and none of it is generated from whatever
libxkbcommon the builder happens to have: the probe's output is committed, so
a change to a keymap is a change to a file somebody reviewed.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/gen-xkb-tables.py           # write the files
    python3 scripts/gen-xkb-tables.py --check   # fail if they are stale
