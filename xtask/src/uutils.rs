//! uutils/coreutils built against ferrousli: the utilities that replace
//! busybox's, as one static multicall binary.
//!
//! `ferrousli/tools/uutils/build.sh` builds it, or `build-windows.sh` beside
//! it on Windows, and installs it as `x86_64/bin/coreutils` under
//! `~/.local/share/ferrix/uutils/ferrousli` (or `$FERRIX_UUTILS`).
//!
//! It is Rust, so unlike busybox it brings its own `std`, and `std` for the
//! musl target brings its own unwinder; ferrousli answers everything below
//! them. `docs/UUTILS.md` is the plan this is the second slice of, and §3a
//! there says why the target is `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` rather than the
//! `-gnu` one ferrousli is closer to.
//!
//! What this module shares with [`crate::busybox`] is in [`crate::ferrousli`].
