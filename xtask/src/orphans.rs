//! Leave nothing running when this program dies of a panic.
//!
//! xtask is built with the workspace's `panic = "abort"`, which the kernel
//! needs and which a profile override cannot change for one package. So a
//! panic runs no destructor: the `Child` that owns a QEMU is never killed or
//! waited for, and QEMU runs on, reparented, with the boot's disk images
//! open and write-locked. The next boot of the same worktree then cannot
//! open them, and the orphan has to be found and killed by hand.
//!
//! Seen on 2026-09-26 in an AArch64 `test-powerfail` under the coverage
//! plugin. `/tmp` had filled its quota -- the compositor tests' leaked
//! frames, since fixed -- and the gate's log was there, so the next
//! `println!` of a serial line panicked with "failed printing to stdout" and
//! the process aborted, core dump and all. The coverage run that had started
//! the gate aborted the same way two seconds later, and QEMU was left holding
//! `btrfs-write.img`. It reproduces without a full disk: pipe the gate's
//! output into a reader that leaves after the firmware's first line, and the
//! next line is "failed printing to stdout: Broken pipe".
//!
//! The panic hook therefore kills every process descended from this one,
//! after the usual message: QEMU, a gate a coverage run started, and the
//! QEMU that gate started. Only this program's own descendants, found by
//! their parent ids, so nothing another session runs is touched. A kill by
//! a signal the program cannot catch, SIGKILL, still leaves them; nothing
//! short of each child being told of its parent's death could help that.
