//! `--ssh <port>`: a watched boot you can log in to.
//!
//! `run-compositor --ssh 2222` forwards the host's `127.0.0.1:2222` to the
//! guest's port 22 and starts `sshdt` there from the compositor's own
//! `exec-once`, so `ssh -p 2222 root@127.0.0.1` reaches the guest as soon as
//! it is up. The server is the one `cargo xtask ports` builds
//! (`ferrousli/tools/ports/sshdt`); without it the forward leads nowhere and
//! the boot says so.
//!
//! # Who may log in
//!
//! Three sources, and the first is always there:
//!
//! 1. **This machine's guest key**, made once at
//!    `~/.local/share/ferrix/ssh/id_ed25519` and authorized by every boot.
//!    It is what a client with no key of its own logs in with, and the boot
//!    prints the `ssh -i` line that uses it.
//! 2. The keys that may already log in to the machine running QEMU: its
//!    user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and the public halves beside it in
//!    `~/.ssh`. This is what lets `remote-desktop` work without a key of its
//!    own: the key this PC logs in to the remote with is in the remote's
//!    `authorized_keys`, and so in the guest's.
//! 3. `--ssh-key <FILE|"ssh-… AAAA…">`, as many as given: a public key named
//!    on the command line, for a client whose key is in neither of those --
//!    another user on the machine, a sandbox, a CI step.
//!
//! The forward only listens on the QEMU host's loopback, so anybody who
//! reaches it is on that machine already; the keys make them prove which of
//! its users they are. Password authentication is never turned on: `sshdt`
//! given no key and no password accepts anyone, which is why source 1 exists
//! rather than a boot that starts no server.
//!
//! The guest key is generated, not borrowed, because a client that has no
//! private key cannot be helped by any number of public ones. Before it
//! existed, `ssh -p <port> root@127.0.0.1 <command>` from such a client
//! failed with `Permission denied (publickey)` -- which reads like a broken
//! session and is an empty `~/.ssh`.
//!
//! # The host key
//!
//! Kept on the machine running QEMU, at
//! `~/.local/share/ferrix/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key`, made with `ssh-keygen`
//! the first time. The initramfs is rebuilt for every boot, so a key the
//! guest made itself would be a new one each time, and `ssh` would refuse the
//! second boot for having changed its key.
