//! `test-sysfs`: sysfs as a running machine shows it, and `bind` and
//! `unbind` going to `devmgr` and back (`docs/SYSFS.md` §5 and §7).
//!
//! The kernel's boot check walks a sysfs before init runs, with the disks
//! and interfaces devmgr's drivers published. This is the half that needs a
//! shell and the devices only a desktop machine has. The gate boots zinc as
//! an interactive shell on a machine with a virtio-gpu, a keyboard, a tablet
//! and a network adapter, and types at it:
//!
//! 1. what libdrm reads to find a card -- `/sys/dev/char/226:0/device`'s
//!    vendor and device, and its `drm` directory -- and a connector's
//!    `status`;
//! 2. an input device's `name` and `capabilities/ev`, the network adapter's
//!    `address` and `operstate`, a disk's `size` and the processors online;
//! 3. a write to a read-only value, which `openat` refuses;
//! 4. the GPU's slot from `/sys/bus/pci/drivers/gpu`, written to `unbind`:
//!    devmgr stops the driver, the kernel says so, the card leaves `/dev/dri`
//!    and the device its `driver` link; `unbind` again is refused;
//! 5. the slot written to `bind`: devmgr starts the driver again, the card
//!    comes back and so does the link; `bind` again is refused, the device
//!    being bound;
//! 6. a line only a live shell can answer.
//!
//! x86-64 only, for the reason `test-restart` is: the shell's test and `echo`
//! are zinc's, but the image is built the same way, carrying uutils, which
//! are built for x86-64 alone (`docs/UUTILS.md` D3).
