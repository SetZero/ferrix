//! (or `$FERRIX_BUSYBOX`), where `--init ferrousli` finds it.
//!
//! `build.sh` compiles x86-64's with the host's `cc` against the host's kernel
//! UAPI headers, and AArch64's and ARMv7-A's with gcc for the target against
//! Alpine's pinned UAPI headers for it. Windows has no `cc`, so
//! `build-windows.sh` cross-compiles x86-64's with clang against Alpine's
//! pinned headers, in Git for Windows' bash; it builds no other. All of them
//! build the same pinned sources with the same config.
