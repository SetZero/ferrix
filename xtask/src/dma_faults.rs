//! Every DMA fault QEMU's VT-d unit records over a run, held to the ones the
//! kernel says it provoked.
//!
//! # The line this is about
//!
//! Every x86-64 boot used to end its stage 10 with this on QEMU's stderr:
//!
//! ```text
//! qemu-system-x86_64: vtd_iova_to_slpte: detected slpte permission error (iova=0x1000, level=0x2, slpte=0x0, write=1, pasid=0xffffffff)
//! qemu-system-x86_64: Interrupt Mask set, irq is not generated
//! qemu-system-x86_64: vtd_iommu_translate: detected translation failure (dev=00:02:00, iova=0x1000)
//! qemu-system-x86_64: New fault is not recorded due to compression of faults
//! ```
//!
//! It is the kernel's doing, and on purpose. Stage 10's exit criterion is a
//! device's write outside its domain, faulted by its unit: `pci/virtio.rs`'s
//! out-of-domain probe gives the virtio-rng function, `00:02.0`, stream
//! `0x10`, a descriptor for page `0x1000`, which its domain does not map, and
//! requires the unit's fault record for it. QEMU's device then writes the 64
//! bytes it was asked for four at a time, and each write faults: sixteen
//! faults, and sometimes a seventeenth for the write-back QEMU drops, all for
//! that page and that stream, in the same instant, and none anywhere else in
//! a boot. `level` is 3 when the domain maps nothing in the first GiB and 2
//! when it maps something there but not in the first 2 MiB: the walk stops at
//! the first empty level, and which that is depends on where the frames the
//! domain does map happen to lie.
//!
//! None of the four can be avoided while the probe is made. QEMU's
//! `vtd_iommu_translate` reports every translation it refuses, whatever the
//! context entry's fault-processing-disable bit says, and the other three
//! follow from the kernel leaving the fault event masked and reading the
//! record itself. And each is `error_report_once`: printed for the first fault
//! of a run and never again. So the line said nothing about the rest of the
//! run: a driver that later gave its device an address it never pinned would
//! have been faulted in silence.
//!
//! # What is done instead
//!
//! A run this tool judges asks QEMU to trace `vtd_dmar_fault`, which fires
//! for every fault, and [`crate::noise`] takes those lines and the four
//! remarks out of stderr. The kernel says, before the probe's doorbell, which
//! stream it is making write which page. When the run is over [`problem`]
//! requires every traced fault to be one of those; the remarks are then
//! redundant and counted rather than shown. A fault that is not the kernel's
//! fails the run and prints the remarks too. The kernel holds its own boot to
//! the same rule by reading the unit's records (`iommu::audit_faults`); this
//! covers the rest of the run as well, a shell's and its drivers'.
//!
//! A QEMU built without the `log` trace backend traces nothing. The remarks
//! are then all there is, and they are printed and not judged.
