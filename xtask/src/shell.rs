//! Stage 7's exit criterion, as a script with an expected transcript.
//!
//! "A static musl `busybox sh` starts, runs a script, and exits." The script
//! is given with `-c`, which puts it in `argv` and needs no filesystem: the
//! roadmap's criterion read as "runs a script", not "runs a script *file*",
//! because a file is stage 8's and would make this stage's exit wait on it.
//!
//! # What the script exercises
//!
//! The parts of a shell that are the shell rather than somebody else's
//! program: variables and arithmetic, a loop, a function with an argument,
//! `test`, `case`, `printf`, the positional parameters, and an exit status
//! the kernel reports back. Nothing that forks, because `clone`, `execve` and
//! `wait4` do not exist yet -- a command substitution or an external command
//! would fail, and the test would be measuring that rather than the ABI.
//!
//! `printf` was left out until stage 8 for a reason of its own: busybox's
//! builtin asks `fcntl(1, F_GETFL)` before it writes and prints nothing when
//! that fails. Descriptor 1 is now an open file in a descriptor table, and the
//! line below is what proves `fcntl` answers it.
//!
//! # Which shell runs it
//!
//! zinc, the shell in `zinc/`, unless `--init` names another. Both are worth
//! running and the gate runs both: zinc is the image's shell, and a static
//! busybox is *somebody else's* binary, which is what stage 7's exit was
//! about — a shell written against this kernel works by construction and
//! proves less about the ABI.
//!
//! A static busybox is built by somebody else for each architecture, and
//! which one to trust is a decision for whoever runs this; `--init` names it.
//! Alpine's `busybox-static` package is what this was first run against:
//! static musl, one build per architecture, and no knowledge of Ferrix.
//!
//! The transcript below is the same under either. It did not move when zinc
//! took over, which is the whole of what `docs/UUTILS.md` S4 had to prove
//! about the script.
