//! The btrfs test disk: the `none` fixture image `scripts/gen-btrfs-fixtures.py`
//! made with real `mkfs.btrfs`, unpacked into a raw image every QEMU machine
//! carries as a second `virtio-blk-pci` device, for stage 11's exit: the
//! kernel mounts it through the ring-3 driver and reads its tree back against
//! the fixture's manifest.
//!
//! The fixture is committed packed — only its non-zero 4 KiB blocks, each
//! behind its 8-byte little-endian offset — because a 128 MiB image of mostly
//! zeros has no business in a repository. Unpacking writes each block at its
//! offset into a file of the image's full size, so the file is sparse where
//! the host's filesystem allows and zeros where it does not; either way the
//! device reads what `mkfs.btrfs` wrote. The image is rewritten whenever it is
//! missing, the wrong size, or its first block differs from the fixture's, so
//! a regenerated fixture reaches the next boot without a step of its own.
//!
//! Attached read-only, after the pattern disk, so the pattern disk stays
//! `vda` and this one is `vdb`, in the order devmgr and the boot check name
//! them. Behind it comes a third: a fresh copy of the `blank` fixture, an
//! empty volume, attached writable as `vdc` for stage 12's check to write on
//! and for host `btrfs check` to read afterwards. That one is rewritten for
//! every boot, because the boot before wrote on it.
