//! `cargo xtask test-seat`: type into a window on Ferrix, from QEMU's far
//! end.
//!
//! `test-input` proves the path from QEMU's `input-send-event` to a program
//! reading `/dev/input/eventN`. `test-compositor` proves the path from a
//! Wayland client's buffer to the pixels on the card. This is the join:
//! QEMU's key goes into a `virtio-keyboard-pci`, out of the kernel's evdev
//! node, into the compositor's seat, across the Wayland socket as
//! `wl_keyboard.key`, and the client says which key it was and draws
//! something else, which the screen then shows.
//!
//! Four things are required, in order, because each is a different failure:
//!
//! 1. **The client has a keyboard and a keymap.** `wl_seat.capabilities` said
//!    the seat has one, and `wl_keyboard.keymap` handed over a real one --
//!    format 1, `XKB_V1`, with a length. `no_keymap` here would be a client
//!    that can never turn a keycode into a letter.
//! 2. **Focus reached it.** `wl_keyboard.enter`, which is the compositor
//!    saying this window is the one being typed into.
//! 3. **The key arrived, and the screen changed.** The line the client
//!    printed names the evdev code QMP sent, and the screendump taken after
//!    it differs from the one before: the client redrew because of the key,
//!    so the whole path is proven by a picture and not only by a log.
//! 4. **A keybind fired.** `bind = SUPER, Q, killactive` in the carried
//!    configuration, pressed through QMP, and the window closes -- which
//!    means the compositor matched the modifier, ate the key rather than
//!    sending it on, and ran a Hyprland dispatcher.
//!
//! The pointer is checked on the way: an absolute position and a click, and
//! the client reports `enter` and the button.
