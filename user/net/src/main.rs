//! The virtio-net driver process: a ring-3 program that carries one
//! interface's frames between the kernel and a virtio-net device.
//!
//! Everything that knows anything is a library. `ferrix-virtio-net` drives the
//! device, `ferrix-netring` speaks the ring, and `ferrix-netserve` joins the
//! two; all three are tested on the host. This program is the handles those
//! libraries were written to be wrapped in, and nothing else:
//!
//! 1. The bootstrap channel carries START (`docs/NET-RING.md` §7): the device
//!    handle and the driver's end of the ring's control channel. A driver that
//!    gets anything else first exits.
//! 2. `device_info` says where the device's virtio register blocks are, and
//!    each becomes an `IoMapping` of the pages holding it. The [`Transport`]
//!    the device library asks for is volatile reads and writes into those.
//! 3. The device's memory — both queues' rings, the virtio headers, and the
//!    two data regions — is VMOs this process creates, pins into the device's
//!    IOMMU domain with `VMO_PIN`, and maps into itself. Device addresses come
//!    only from the pin's address query.
//! 4. The net ring is one more VMO, mapped here and sent to the kernel in
//!    HELLO with the data VMO and a port the kernel rings. READY brings the
//!    kernel's completion port back.
//! 5. One port carries every event: the kernel's bell, the device's interrupt,
//!    and the control channel becoming readable.
//! 6. STOP ends it: the device is reset, the interface goes with the ring, and
//!    STOPPED goes back. A device that will not reset keeps its memory for
//!    ever — the pins are never released — and the process exits without
//!    STOPPED, which tells the kernel to reset through its own means.
//!
//! The exit status is the diagnosis: 0 is a clean STOP, and every other number
//! names the step that failed (see [`Step`]), so a boot check that started the
//! process can say what went wrong without a console.
