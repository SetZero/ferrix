# Replacing busybox with the uutils family and zinc

Version 1. Written 2026-09-17 on the customer's order: *replace busybox with
uutils/coreutils*, and *btop, git and curl should link against ferrousli*.
The three scope decisions in §2 are the product owner's, taken the same day.
§3 is a spike that was run before any of this was written, and it is the
reason the plan below is a plan rather than a proposal.

## 1. What busybox is doing here, and why it goes

busybox is the userland Ferrix is measured with. One static binary lands in
the initramfs at `/bin/busybox`, every applet name is a symlink beside it, and
three gates drive it: `test-shell` runs `sh -c` with a script, `test-vfs` runs
stage 8's exit programs and a sweep of applets, and `test-net` configures
`eth0` and fetches a file. It is also ferrousli's main consumer: the busybox
built against ferrousli is the primary one, and `undefined-symbols.txt` from
its failed link has been ferrousli's to-do list since it was written.

Two reasons it goes. It is C, in a tree whose case is that an operating system
is better written in Rust, and the exception has never been argued for — only
tolerated because nothing else could boot. And it drags the kernel's UAPI
headers in with it: `ferrousli/tools/busybox/` needs the host's `<linux/*>` on
Linux and Alpine's pinned copy on Windows, and ferrousli carries three
pass-through headers for it. Both go when busybox goes.

**This document does not claim uutils is a busybox replacement.** It is not.
uutils/coreutils is a *GNU coreutils* replacement: 105 utilities, no shell, no
networking, no `grep`, `sed`, `awk` or `tar`. What replaces busybox is a set:
the uutils family for the utilities, zinc for the shell, and — for a while —
nothing at all for a list this document names in §5 and does not hide.

## 2. The product owner's decisions, 2026-09-17

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | uutils has no shell, and the gates all run `sh` | **zinc becomes the shell.** `/bin/sh` is zinc; `test-shell`'s script and every `sh -c` in the gates run it |
| D2 | What happens to the applets uutils/coreutils lacks | **Bring in the uutils family**: findutils, diffutils, procps and util-linux beside coreutils |
| D3 | uutils is Rust, so it links Rust's `std`, not ferrousli | **ferrousli only.** One build, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` with `+crt-static`, `libferrousli.a` in glibc's place. No musl build |

D3 is the consequential one. It costs the AArch64 and ARMv7-A userland that a
musl build would have given for nothing, because ferrousli is built for x86-64
alone; and it puts every one of these programs on ferrousli's correctness,
with no second implementation to compare against when one misbehaves. It buys
the thing that made busybox worth having: a large, real, hostile consumer of
the C library, which is what has driven ferrousli's POSIX work all along.
**On AArch64 and ARMv7-A the image carries zinc and nothing else** until
ferrousli is built for those architectures. That is a new backlog row, not a
thing this plan solves.

## 3. The spike: Rust `std` links against ferrousli, and so does uutils

Run on nazuna, 2026-09-17, before the plan was written, because everything
here rests on an unproven claim: that Rust's `std` for a glibc target can be
linked against ferrousli the way busybox's C is.

**Part one — a `std` hello-world.** Built for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` with
`-C target-feature=+crt-static -C link-self-contained=no` and a linker wrapper
giving ferrousli's `crt1.o` and `libferrousli.a` and nothing from the host's C
library — the shape `ferrousli/tools/busybox/build.sh` already uses. Three
things stopped it:

1. `rust_eh_personality` is defined by ferrousli *and* by `std`. ferrousli is
   itself a Rust staticlib, so it exports its own. The spike made ferrousli's
   copy local with `objcopy --localize-symbol`; the real fix is ferrousli's.
2. `dlsym` is missing. `std`'s weak-symbol machinery calls it. A static
   program has nothing to look up and musl's static `dlsym` returns null.
3. `_dl_find_object` is missing. The host's `libgcc_eh` calls it first and
   falls back to `dl_iterate_phdr`, which ferrousli has, when told "not found".

With those three worked around, the program **linked and ran**: arguments,
environment, current directory, a file written and read back, a spawned
`std::thread` that returned a value, and an exit status of 7 the shell saw.

**Part two — uutils/coreutils 0.9.0 itself**, `--no-default-features
--features feat_os_unix_musl` (the feature set uutils already maintains for
targets that cannot produce the `cdylib` that `stdbuf` needs). The whole tree
compiled — ~340 crates, `nix`, `crossterm`, `jiff`, `onig_sys`'s C — and the
link named **17 undefined symbols and nothing else**:

```
cfsetispeed@GLIBC_2.2.5   posix_spawnattr_init          posix_spawn_file_actions_init
cfsetospeed@GLIBC_2.2.5   posix_spawnattr_setflags      posix_spawnp
gnu_get_libc_version      posix_spawnattr_setpgroup     pthread_atfork
lutimes                   posix_spawnattr_setsigdefault __res_init
__memcpy_chk              posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2  splice
posix_spawnattr_destroy   posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy
```

Four notes on that list. `posix_spawn` is nine of the seventeen, and
`include/spawn.h` already declares all of it — musl's header is there and the
implementation is not; `src/spawn.rs`'s own comment says so. The two `termios`
functions exist in `src/termios.rs` but the `libc` crate asks for them by
their versioned glibc names, so ferrousli owes a `.symver` alias, not a
function. `__memcpy_chk` comes from `onig_sys`'s fortified C and brings the
rest of the `_chk` family with it. `__res_init` is a no-op in musl.

**This is the result that makes the rest of the document a plan.** The risk
that mattered — that Rust's `std` and ferrousli were simply incompatible —
is retired.

**Part three — S1, and the link with nothing stubbed.** The seventeen went
into ferrousli, and the spike ran again against that library with no shim
archive and no localized symbol. uutils/coreutils 0.9.0 **links with zero
undefined symbols** and the 14 MiB static binary runs on the host. That is
S1's exit, and it is met.

## 3a. The one thing this plan did not expect, and what it changed

`coreutils echo hi` prints uutils' usage and says `<unknown binary name>`. It
is not a ferrousli fault, and the control says so: the same probe built as a
**static glibc** binary, no ferrousli anywhere, behaves identically, while the
ordinary dynamic glibc build works.

The cause is `src/common/validation.rs` in uutils. On Linux, when the target
environment is not musl, it does not trust `argv[0]`; it asks
`rustix::param::linux_execfn()` for the kernel's `AT_EXECFN` and prefers that,
to stop `env -a` bypassing AppArmor and SELinux on hard-linked binaries. In
rustix 1.1.5's `linux_raw` backend that value is read through `prctl`'s
`PR_GET_AUXV` or `/proc/self/auxv`, never through the C library, and in a
static binary it comes back empty. uutils then has no name, and the multicall
dispatch — which is the whole of how `/bin/ls` becomes `ls` — never happens.

ferrousli's `getauxval(AT_EXECFN)` answers correctly; a C program against this
library prints the path. rustix simply does not ask it.

Three ways out were on the table:

1. **Build for the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` triple, still linking
   ferrousli.** uutils' `#[cfg(not(target_env = "musl"))]` then falls away and
   it uses `argv[0]`. It also suits ferrousli, whose headers *are* musl's.
2. **Carry a patch to uutils' `validation.rs`.** Smallest change, and a patch
   to maintain for ever against a moving upstream.
3. **Give one binary per utility instead of a multicall one.** No dispatch to
   get right, and roughly a hundred copies of a 14 MiB binary, which the
   initramfs cannot hold.

**It is (1), and it was measured rather than argued.** uutils/coreutils builds
for the musl triple against ferrousli with **zero undefined symbols and no
duplicate ones**, and every part of the dispatch then works: a symlink named
`ls` lists, `sort`, `wc`, `seq`, `head` and `uname` all run as themselves,
`coreutils echo hi` takes the second-argument form, and `env` starts another
program.

That was on a Linux host. Since S3 it is also true **on Ferrix**: `test-vfs`
runs the multicall form, the symlink dispatch and a file read there, and
`uname -sm` prints `Ferrix x86_64`.

Two things had to be got right, and neither was `rust_begin_unwind`, which
does not in fact clash on this triple:

* **The unwinder.** The musl target names `-lunwind` where the gnu target
  named `-lgcc_eh`, and `std`'s panic machinery really calls into it. rustc
  ships the answer — `self-contained/libunwind.a` — for this target on Linux
  **and on Windows**, which is what lets the Windows build work the same way.
  It is copied rather than reached with `-L`, so the linker cannot satisfy
  `-lc` from musl's `libc.a` sitting beside it.
* **The toolchain.** uutils is unpacked and built outside the repository,
  where rustup falls back to the machine's default — older than ferrousli's
  `rust-version`, and with no musl target installed. Both scripts read the
  channel out of `rust-toolchain.toml` and name it.

So D3 stands as the product owner set it: one build, against ferrousli, no
musl C library anywhere. Only the *triple* changed, and with it the reason for
the triple, which is now written down where it is used.

## 4. Where each part of the userland comes from

| Source | Pinned at | Gives |
|---|---|---|
| zinc | in tree | `sh`, and the init the kernel starts |
| uutils/coreutils | 0.9.0 | the 105: `cat ls cp mv rm mkdir chmod chown stat head tail wc od dd ln readlink truncate touch env id printf echo test sleep seq sort uniq cut tr df du mknod mkfifo tty stty uname hostname nproc kill nohup timeout base64 md5sum sha256sum shuf split comm paste expr factor yes tee sync chroot nice pwd true false …` |
| uutils/findutils | 0.9.1 | `find`, `xargs`, `locate`, `updatedb` |
| uutils/diffutils | v0.5.0 | `diff`, `cmp` |
| uutils/procps | 0.0.1 | `ps`, `top`, `free`, `pwdx`, `w`, `watch`, `sysctl`, `pgrep`, `pkill`, `pidof`, `pmap`, `vmstat`, `slabtop`, `tload` |
| uutils/util-linux | 0.0.1 | `dmesg`, `last`, `mountpoint`, `rev`, `setsid`, `hexdump`, `lscpu`, `blockdev`, `renice`, `cal`, `mesg`, `nologin`, `uuidgen` |
| ports, against ferrousli | as pinned | `curl`, `btop`, and **`git`**, the new one the customer named |

`procps` covers more of `test-vfs` than was expected: `sysctl`, `top`, `pwdx`
and `w` are all there, and they are four of the applets the `/proc` checks
were written around. Both `procps` and `util-linux` are at `0.0.1` and will
disappoint somewhere; where they do, the row says so rather than the gate
being deleted.

## 5. What nobody provides, and what that costs

Named here so that no gate is quietly dropped:

| Missing | Used by | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `ifconfig`, `route`, `netstat`, `arp`, `ip`, `udhcpc`, `ping`, `nslookup`, `nc`, `wget` | **all of `test-net`** | `test-net` keeps busybox until Ferrix has its own. `curl` already replaces `wget` for the fetch |
| `grep`, `sed`, `awk` | scripts in `test-vfs`, and every real script | zinc's own pattern matching covers some; the rest is a row |
| `tar`, `gzip`, `cpio` | nothing gated today | a row, low |
| `mount`, `umount`, `fdisk`, `swapon`, `losetup` | `test-vfs` mount checks | util-linux has none of them yet; a row |
| `su`, `adduser`, `passwd`, `login`, `getty` | the multi-user slices (`dac`…`dac5`) | a row, and those slices keep busybox until it is filled |
| `vi`, `less` | nothing gated | not replaced |

**So busybox does not leave in one step.** It leaves `test-shell` and the
`test-vfs` rows the uutils family covers, and stays in the image — as one
binary with a shrinking symlink set — for `test-net` and the rows above. The
last slice in §6 is the one that deletes it, and it is not scheduled here.

## 6. The slices

Points, not time, per the customer's rule. Each lands on `main` with the gate
its table row in `docs/BACKLOG.md` names.

| # | Slice | Points | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Done.** ferrousli gained the 17: `posix_spawn` and its eight, `pthread_atfork`, `splice`, `lutimes`, `__res_init`, `gnu_get_libc_version`, three `_chk` functions, the two versioned `termios` names, `dlsym` and the rest of `dlfcn.h`, `_dl_find_object`, and a weak `rust_eh_personality`. `execvpe` and `errno::get` came with `posix_spawn`, and the `.init_array` constructors now get `argc`, `argv` and `envp` as glibc and musl pass them | 8 | `check --ferrousli` passes; uutils links with 0 undefined symbols |
| S2 | **Done.** `ferrousli/tools/uutils/` (`sources.sh`, `build.sh`, `build-windows.sh`) and `cargo xtask uutils`. What it shares with busybox moved to `xtask/src/ferrousli.rs`, which is what stays when S8 deletes `busybox.rs`. The staleness rule is written and unused until S3 calls it | 5 | builds on Linux and on Windows; the Windows-built binary runs on Linux |
| S3 | **Done.** Every image that carries a program carries `/bin/coreutils`, with each of the 106 utility names linked in `/usr/bin` — not `/bin`, which stays busybox's, so no gate runs a different program than it did. Three `test-vfs` rows, reported as a group of their own, run uutils on Ferrix for the first time | 3 | the three rows pass on Ferrix: the multicall form, the symlink dispatch, and a file read |
| S4 | **`/bin/sh` is zinc, in one landing**: the kernel (which hardcodes `/bin/busybox` and `sh -i` in `init.rs`), `test-shell`'s transcript, and `test-vfs`'s 18 `sh -c` scripts, all re-recorded together. It cannot be split — between any two of those landings `main` is red | 13 | the whole matrix: a kernel change, so the release build and the four boots |
| S5 | *Folded into S4.* The `test-vfs` rows break the moment the shell changes, so they are re-recorded in the same landing | — | — |
| S6 | findutils, diffutils, procps and util-linux built and installed the same way | 5 | `test-vfs`'s rows that need them |
| S7 | `git` as a ferrousli port, beside `curl` and `btop` | 8 | it clones and commits on Ferrix |
| S8 | busybox deleted: `tools/busybox/`, `xtask/src/busybox.rs`, the UAPI headers, ferrousli's three `<linux/*>` pass-throughs, the applet list | 3 | the whole matrix, once §5 is empty |

S1, S2 and S3 have landed and §3a is settled. What is left is **S4, the
one that matters**: it is the landing that makes uutils and zinc the
userland rather than passengers in the image, and it is 13 points in one
piece. S6 and S7 can go in parallel with it. S8 is blocked on §5 and is not
scheduled.

**23 points left of S4-S7.**

**Total, S1–S7: 42 points**, of which S1, S2 and S3 are done. S8 is 3 more, whenever §5 empties.

S3 was quoted at 2 and cost 3: the two `test-vfs` groups became three, which the runner and the judging both had to agree about, per architecture.

## 7. Risks

* **`procps` and `util-linux` are `0.0.1`.** `test-vfs` checks what a program
  printed, not only that it exited. Early versions will differ from busybox in
  ways that are not bugs. Each such row is re-recorded, not deleted, and the
  commit says which program's output it now holds.
* **One C library, no control.** D3 leaves every utility resting on ferrousli
  with nothing to compare against. When a utility misbehaves on Ferrix the
  question "ferrousli or the kernel?" loses the answer busybox's musl and
  glibc builds used to give. The mitigation is that uutils runs on the Linux
  host too, against the host's glibc, which is the comparison that remains.
* **`std` is a much larger consumer than busybox was.** 17 symbols is what
  *linking* needs. What ferrousli must get *right* for `std` — threads, TLS,
  `posix_spawn`, signals — is a larger surface than busybox ever touched, and
  the failures will be at run time, not at link time.
* **zinc is on the critical path early.** D1 puts a shell that has no job
  control, no line editor and no completion in front of every gate. The `sh
  -i` and controlling-terminal checks stage 7 owns have no home until zinc has
  job control; they keep busybox's `sh` until it does.
