# Claude Code on Ferrix

Asked by the customer on 2026-09-30: "add Claude Code (CLI first, then the
desktop) to Ferrix". This is the account of the first half -- the command
line -- and of what running it found. The desktop app is §7.

## Where it stands, 2026-09-30

**Claude Code runs on Ferrix, since 2026-09-30.** Anthropic's prebuilt
native release 2.1.280 for linux-x64 -- not one built here -- starts on
Ferrix, takes a prompt with `claude -p`, sends it to a Messages API, runs
the Bash command the model answers with in bash on Ferrix, and sends back
what it printed. `cargo xtask test-claude-code` requires all of it, against
an API xtask serves itself (§4), in about two seconds of the guest's time.

**Certification review (consultant, 2026-09-30): OK**, on b0db74ef, after a
first round on 672611b6. The change is core ring (arch/x86_64: cpu.rs,
switch.rs, signal.rs, smp.rs, mod.rs) and adds no upward reference. Its
unsafe is core::arch's XSAVE64, XRSTOR64, FXSAVE64, FXRSTOR64 and XSETBV
intrinsics, each with a (CONTEXT) obligation, and there is less assembly
than before. rt_sigreturn takes only XSTATE_BV and the YMM upper halves
from a frame: XSTATE_BV is masked to AVX, x87 and SSE and then to XCR0,
and XCOMP_BV and the reserved header bytes come from the kernel's own
XSAVE, never from user memory. So no program can make XRSTOR fault in ring
0. The xstate boot line (check_a_poisoned_xsave_header_comes_back_safely,
L.x86_64.122) returns a frame whose whole header is ones; with both masks
removed, the boot stopped on #GP under TCG and KVM. A thread starts, and
an exec restarts, with AVX outside XSTATE_BV, so no YMM state crosses
processes. Enabling AVX exposes Zenbleed (CVE-2023-20593) and GDS
(CVE-2022-40982). SPECULATION.md §3 and §9 record that the kernel
mitigates neither today, and that under KVM the host's microcode and
chicken bit do. A BACKLOG row owes keeping XCR0 at x87 and SSE on an
unmitigated processor when the speculation switch is on. L.x86_64.121,
enabling the state on every processor, is baselined: every SMP boot
exercises it, since a processor without it faults on its first user
switch. The i386 frame stays FXSAVE-only (BACKLOG).

## 1. What Claude Code is, to an operating system

Since 2.1 Claude Code ships as a native program rather than an npm package:
Bun, a JavaScript runtime built on JavaScriptCore, with Claude Code's
JavaScript and its ripgrep bundled into one 234 MB executable. The linux-x64
build is a non-PIE glibc program that needs nothing of the system's but
glibc itself -- `libc`, `libm`, `libpthread`, `libdl`, `librt` -- and reads
its own bundle out of its executable. What it does with the system is what
Chrome does, less a display: threads, `futex`, `epoll`, `eventfd`,
JavaScriptCore's JIT, TCP through the resolver, `fork` and `execve` of a
shell for every tool call, and pipes back from it.

Everything a browser needed had been built for Chrome (`docs/CHROME.md`):
`execve` of a program past 64 MiB mapped from its file, the vDSO,
`madvise`, `timerfd`, the network. So the expectation was a short list of
missing calls. The list had one entry, and it was not a call.

## 2. The volume

`tools/common/fetch/fetch-claude-code.sh` makes a btrfs volume, as
`fetch-chrome.sh` does, from pinned downloads:

* `claude` 2.1.280 for linux-x64, the stable channel's release on
  2026-09-30, from `downloads.claude.ai`, the URL Anthropic's `install.sh`
  uses, checked against the SHA-256 that release's `manifest.json`
  publishes;
* Debian 13's `libc6` -- the pin Chrome's volume takes -- `libgcc-s1`,
  `bash`, `libtinfo6`, `ripgrep` and `libpcre2-8-0`.

bash because Claude Code's Bash tool runs every command in bash or zsh and
in nothing else, and `SHELL` points it at the volume's. The script checks
that every library each program on the volume needs is on it, which caught
ripgrep's PCRE2 the first time it ran.

The volume is mounted at `/data`, under QEMU's `snapshot=on`, and the
initramfs links glibc's paths into it (`claude_code::LINKS`), as Chrome's
test does.

## 3. What running it found: no AVX

`claude --version` answered at once. `claude -p` never made a request: its
main thread ran at full speed, in state R, for as long as it was given, and
made no system call after its first 1.5 seconds. It wrote nothing, not even
its configuration directory.

A trial kernel, never landed, sampled the thread's user instruction pointer
at each timer interrupt and walked its frame pointers through the user
stack. Every sample was in the same place:
JavaScript calling Bun's conversion of a string to UTF-8, which called,
through a lazily built object's table, a function that did nothing but
return the pair `(11, 0)`. That is simdutf's *unsupported implementation*:
error `OTHER`, nothing converted. The conversion loop asks again for the
rest, and there is always all of it left.

simdutf chooses its implementation at run time from what the processor
offers. Bun's x86-64 build -- the one Claude Code ships -- is compiled for
Haswell and carries no implementation older than AVX2, and a program may
use AVX only when `CPUID` says the operating system saves it (`OSXSAVE`) and
`XGETBV` says it is enabled. On Ferrix neither was true twice over:

* **The kernel** saved a program's floating-point state with `FXSAVE`, which
  holds x87 and SSE and not the upper halves of the `YMM` registers, and so
  never set `CR4.OSXSAVE`. A program could not use AVX under it even on a
  processor that had it.
* **QEMU's model**: xtask booted every x86-64 guest on `qemu64`, which has
  SSE3 and nothing after it -- no SSSE3, no SSE4, no `XSAVE`, no AVX.

Chrome ran on both because it chooses its code at run time all the way down
to SSE2. Anything built for x86-64-v3 without a fallback -- which is most of
what distributions now ship for "modern" x86 -- could not.

### The fix

**In the kernel** (`src/kernel/src/arch/x86_64/`):

* `cpu::enable_extended_state` sets `CR4.OSXSAVE` and puts x87, SSE and AVX
  in `XCR0` on the boot processor; each secondary loads the same `XCR0` as it
  starts (`smp::secondary_start`), having taken `CR4` from the boot
  processor already. Only those three components, even on a processor with
  AVX-512 or AMX: each further one grows every thread's saved state and
  every signal frame, and a program asks `XCR0` before using them.
* The switch saves and restores a program's registers with `XSAVE64` and
  `XRSTOR64` into an 832-byte area in the standard form, 64-byte aligned, in
  place of the 512-byte `FXSAVE` area (`switch::UserState`). A processor
  without `XSAVE` keeps `FXSAVE`; the boot log says which:
  `program register state: x87, SSE and AVX, saved with XSAVE`.
* A signal frame carries the `XSAVE` area as Linux lays it out: the
  software-reserved bytes of the `FXSAVE` part say so
  (`FP_XSTATE_MAGIC1`, the sizes, the components), the header and the
  `YMM` upper halves follow, then `FP_XSTATE_MAGIC2`, and `uc_flags` has
  `UC_FP_XSTATE`. `rt_sigreturn` takes AVX back only from a whole area,
  and otherwise returns it to its initial state, as Linux does. So a
  handler that uses AVX -- glibc's `memcpy` does -- no longer hands the
  code it interrupted different registers.

Without the switch saving the upper halves, the first run with AVX turned
on and nothing else changed printed Claude Code's answer and then crashed as
Bun left, at address 0, with four threads taking turns on one processor.
With it, the crash is gone.

**In xtask** (`qemu::x86_cpu`): every x86-64 guest gets x86-64-v3's
instructions, under every accelerator -- SSSE3 to SSE4.2, `XSAVE`, AVX and
AVX2, BMI1 and 2, FMA, F16C, `MOVBE`, `LZCNT`, `PCLMULQDQ` and AES. Every
x86-64 processor sold in the last decade has them, and TCG emulates them
all since QEMU 7.2. The coverage suite's own model, which has none, keeps
`FXSAVE`'s path exercised.

And `XSAVEOPT`, for a reason that is QEMU's: its TCG takes `CR4.OSXSAVE` for
a reserved bit unless the model has one of `CPUID` leaf 0xD's sub-leaf 1
features (`cr4_reserved_bits` tests `FEAT_XSAVE`, not leaf 1's `XSAVE`).
On `qemu64,+xsave` the kernel's write of `CR4` then became an SVM exit
outside any guest, which restarts the instruction: the boot stopped on one
`mov cr4`, forever, with no exception logged, under QEMU 9.2 and 10.2
alike, and ran under KVM, which checks `CR4` itself. Every processor with
AVX has `XSAVEOPT`, so the model is still one that exists.

The i386 signal frame (`signal/compat.rs`) still carries `FXSAVE` alone: a
32-bit program's handler that uses AVX would leave the interrupted code's
upper halves changed. Steam's 32-bit programs are the only ones, and none
seen so far uses AVX in a handler; the row is in `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

## 4. The gate: `cargo xtask test-claude-code`

One boot, x86-64, with the network. The script takes a lease for `eth0`,
runs `claude --version`, then one prompt:

```
claude -p 'ferrix-gate: run the check' --allowedTools Bash --max-turns 3 < /dev/null
```

`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points at a Messages API in a thread of xtask
(`claude_code::Api`), on the host's loopback, which the guest reaches as
`10.0.2.2` through the gateway, as `test-net`'s servers are reached. It
requires the made-up key the script gives, and answers:

* the prompt, when it comes with tools, with a call of the Bash tool
  running `echo ferrix-bash-$((6*7)); uname -s`, streamed as the API
  streams one;
* the request that carries that command's output back as a tool result --
  `ferrix-bash-42`, then `Ferrix` -- with the text
  `claude-code-gate: bash on Ferrix said ferrix-bash-42`;
* anything else Claude Code asks on its own with a word, and its keyless
  reachability check, `HEAD /api/hello`, with an empty 200.

The gate passes when `--version` printed Claude Code's version, the guest
printed that last text, the API saw the tool result, and the script got to
its end. The text exists only if bash ran the command on Ferrix: the
script's source holds neither `42` nor the reply. No model is called, no
account is needed, nothing leaves the host, and the result is the same on
a machine with no internet. `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`
keeps the telemetry, error reports and update checks at home.

`-p` reads its input as more of the prompt until the end of it, whenever
the input is not a terminal, and the console is not one to it: the script
gives it `/dev/null`.

**The negative control** (2026-09-30): the same gate with
`FERRIX_X86_CPU` set to the model before this change fails -- the boot log
says `saved with FXSAVE; no XSAVE, so no AVX`, and `claude -p` spins until
the timeout.

## 5. On the desktop, and what is left for the command line

**`claude` in the desktop's terminals** (2026-09-30). `run-compositor
--everything` merges this volume's tree into the one data volume that
desktop mounts, beside rustc's, Chrome's, steamcmd's and yserver's
(`everything.rs`), once `fetch-claude-code.sh` has made it; the only path
two of them share with different contents is `libgcc_s.so.1`, which the
merge already settles for Chrome's copy of the same file. The image then
carries `/bin/claude` (`claude_code::WRAPPER`), which runs
`/data/claude-code/claude` with `SHELL` naming the volume's bash -- the
terminals' shell is zinc -- and Claude Code's updater off, since the volume
is started afresh every boot. `cargo xtask remote-desktop` boots
`run-compositor --everything` on the machine it names, so its desktop has
`claude` wherever the volume has been fetched there.
`cargo xtask test-claude-code --everything` runs the gate's script on that
merged volume, through the same `/bin/claude`, so what it passes is what a
terminal on the desktop runs. The plain gate goes through `/bin/claude`
too.

What is left:

* **The interactive TUI.** `claude` without `-p`, in a terminal: raw mode,
  the alternate screen, key input, resizes. Not gated yet. The console is
  not a terminal to it; foot on the compositor is, and so is `sshdt`'s
  pseudo-terminal, which is where a gate would drive it. One thing to
  check there: Bun passes a file descriptor to `ioctl` as a NaN-boxed
  JavaScript value (`0xfffe000000000001` for 1), whose upper half Linux
  ignores because the argument is an `unsigned int`. Every call seen so far
  was on a file that is not a terminal, where the answer is `ENOTTY` either
  way.
* **A real account.** `claude` logs in through a browser, or takes
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; both need the real internet through the gateway,
  which a watched desktop has. Unmeasured on Ferrix.
* Both rows are in `docs/BACKLOG.md` (P2).

## 6. Elsewhere

* **ferrousli in glibc's place**, as Chrome runs (`test-chrome
  --interpreter ferrousli --library ferrousli`): Claude Code imports only
  glibc's own names, so this should be the shortest of Chrome's steps.
* **AArch64**: Anthropic publishes linux-arm64, for the Pixel 7's VM; its
  Bun build needs no AVX.

## 7. The desktop app

Asked for second. Anthropic builds the Claude desktop app for macOS and
Windows only: an Electron application. The customer chose, on 2026-09-30,
the Electron app itself over Claude Code in a desktop window or claude.ai
in Chrome, knowing it has no Linux build; the next step is an assessment
of what running its Windows bundle's JavaScript on Linux's Electron on
Ferrix would take, before anything is built.
