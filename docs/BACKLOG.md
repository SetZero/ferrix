# Ferrix — backlog and decisions

`docs/ROADMAP.md` says what each stage is and how it knows it is finished.
This file says who is doing what right now, in what order, and which
decisions were taken along the way. It exists because a dozen sessions work on
the tree at once, and a decision that lives only in a message between two of
them is a decision the third one reverts.

The product owner keeps this file. A session that lands a piece of it updates
its row in the same landing, the way the roadmap's stage sections are updated.
When a row is done it is deleted, not struck through; the roadmap records what
landed.

## Standing rules

These add to `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, which still governs commits.

**What a landing runs.** Rebase onto `main`, then:

| The change touches | Gate |
|---|---|
| Only `docs/` | `cargo xtask check` |
| Only `ferrousli/` | `cargo xtask check --ferrousli`, then `cargo xtask busybox` and, with the busybox it built, `test-shell` and `test-vfs` on x86_64 with `--init ferrousli`, so the binary the gates run never lags the library |
| `libs/` only, and no crate the kernel builds | `cargo xtask check`, and one boot: `test-boot --arch armv7a --smp 2` |
| Anything the image contains: `kernel/`, `boot/`, a kernel-side crate in `libs/`, `xtask` | `cargo xtask check`, then `test-boot` on x86_64, aarch64, armv7a at four processors and armv7a at `--smp 2`; a stage 7 or 8 change also runs `test-shell` on x86_64 with the ferrousli busybox (`--init ferrousli`), the musl busybox *and* the host's glibc busybox (`/usr/bin/busybox`), and `test-vfs` on x86_64 with the ferrousli busybox and the musl one. The whole of that, plus KVM, is what moves `main` |
| User mode, page tables, TLB, SMP or the scheduler | The row above, and x86_64 under `--accel kvm` |

Then fast-forward `develop` only if it is still the commit rebased onto.

**The busyboxes.** The busybox built against ferrousli is the primary one: the
userland Ferrix is measured with, and the one every `test-shell` and
`test-vfs` above names first. `cargo xtask busybox` builds and installs it and
`--init ferrousli` runs it; the flag is still given explicitly, since xtask
has no default program. Alpine's static musl busybox and the host's glibc
busybox stay required in every gate that names them, as the compatibility
checks: a failure on any of the three fails the gate, and nothing was dropped
when ferrousli's joined. `--init ferrousli` runs whatever `cargo xtask busybox`
last installed, so on a base whose `ferrousli/` differs from the one the
binary was built from, rebuild it first.

**After the fast-forward,** the lander boots `develop` itself once on x86_64
under `--accel kvm` and reports the hash together with that result, so a bad
merge is seen by the one who made it.

**Two branches.** Sessions land on `develop`, which may be unstable. `main`
moves only by the product owner, fast-forward, to a `develop` commit that has
passed the whole matrix from a clean worktree on the product owner's own run:
the four boots, x86_64 under KVM, `test-shell` with the ferrousli, the musl
and the glibc busybox, and `test-vfs` with the ferrousli and the musl busybox;
at least every two hours while `develop` moves. So
`main` is always a working tree by construction, and a failure the customer
finds on it is fixed forward on `develop` and re-verified before `main`
moves again. Tags go on `main`. A landing on `develop` from a worktree is
`git push <root> <branch>:develop`, which refuses anything but a
fast-forward; the root checkout keeps `main` checked out and never lands
`develop` through its index.

**The landing queue.** Image changes on `develop` queue; documentation, ferrousli and
host-only `libs/` landings do not. A session whose image change has passed
its row tells the product owner "ready to land" with the base it verified
on; the product owner answers with its place in the queue and says "go" when
the landing before it has fast-forwarded. Nobody fast-forwards an image
change without a go, and a go lapses after 30 minutes. This exists because
on 2026-09-13 a 25-minute row kept losing to a `main` that moved every ten
minutes, and one branch passed on seven bases without landing.

**Re-verifying after `main` moved.** When the commits that moved it touch
none of the files the change touches, re-run `cargo xtask check` and two
boots, `armv7a --smp 2` and x86_64 under `--accel kvm`, then land. When the
files overlap, or the change is cross-cutting (locks, the scheduler, the
trap or system-call entry, memory management), run the whole row again; the
product owner may ask for the whole row in any case. A boot that fails is a
result to read, not a reason to retry: only the stage 5 EEVDF-bound message
was ever a known flake, and it is fixed.

**Worktrees.** One landing, one worktree. `git worktree remove` it once its
branch is on `main`. Check `df -h /` before a landing; after a failed commit
read `git log -1 --stat` before the next step, because a failed commit leaves
its files staged for the next one. On 2026-09-13 the root filesystem filled and
every session's gates failed at once; 70 worktrees held 108 GB of build output.

**The host is shared.** One cargo build, clippy run or QEMU boot at a time
per session, agents included: a session with agents serialises them. Miri and
fuzz runs one at a time machine-wide, and never while a boot matrix runs
anywhere. No worktree under `/tmp`: it is a 30 GB tmpfs, so a build tree
there lives in RAM; the scratchpad is for logs and patches only. Run `free -g`
before a boot matrix and wait while available memory is under 12 GB. On
2026-09-13 the host reached 47 of 59 GB used with swap full, and the customer
reported it close to stalling: three worktrees on the tmpfs held 9 GB of build
output, and ten sessions were building and booting at once.

**Agents.** Gates and boots in the foreground, never `run_in_background`; one
architecture per tool call; the brief says so.

**Milestones.** The customer tests from `main`, so testable progress is tagged
there rather than waiting for a stage to end. The product owner verifies a
candidate from a clean worktree (`test-boot` on all three architectures and
armv7a at `--smp 2`, `test-shell` and `test-vfs` with the ferrousli busybox and
the musl one),
then tags it: `stage-N` for a stage's exit, `stage-N.k-<slug>` for a testable
step after it, annotated, with the tag message carrying short release notes as a bullet
list and saying what to test and how; the same notes go into
`docs/RELEASES.md`.
Owners say in one line what a person can test when such a landing is on
`main`. Tags are local until the customer pushes; the customer is told in a
line or two and nothing stops for it.

**Calling a stage done.** The exit criterion as written, on all three
architectures, and the marker moves in the same commit. A criterion met in a
weaker form is written down as such in the stage's section.

## Owners

Session names change on every restart; the table carries the current name
and the one the rows below were written under. `ListAgents` shows what is
alive.

| Session | Area |
|---|---|
| ferrix-32 (was ferrix-24) | Product owner: priorities, decisions, this file, milestones, cross-cutting debt |
| ferrix-a5 (was ferrix-91) | Stage 7: processes, signals, threads, tty, futex, time; the user entry path |
| ferrix-e6 (was ferrix-c2) | Stage 8: VFS, tmpfs, devfs, procfs, pipes, the fd and path calls; file-backed `mmap` |
| ferrix-4b (was ferrix-2a) | Stage 9: native ABI, objects, `vmo_map`, native process creation, process observers |
| ferrix-d9 (was ferrix-8b) | Stage 10: PCI, IOMMU domains, `devmgr`, the block ring, virtio-blk in ring 3 |
| ferrix-61 (was ferrix-4d) | Stage 11: `libs/btrfs`, `libs/block`, the kernel mount; the native user-space runtime |
| ferrix-34 (was ferrix-b9) | Scheduler: stage 5 flakes, lock convoys, wake latency, boot-time performance |
| ferrix-e5 (was ferrix-54) | The memory-management package below; reviewer of the VMO reverse map and the space.rs half of file-backed mmap |
| ferrix-4f (was ferrix-b1) | `xtask flash` and `deploy`, `docs/stm32mp157-dk.md`, the Arm UART drivers and console receive |
| ferrix-3c | The STM32MP157D-DK1 board itself: the serial link, OpenOCD, every hardware run, and filing what the board shows with the area that owns it |
| ferrix-ce (was ferrix-53) | `ferrousli/`, beside the roadmap. Done: locales and wide characters; time zones, `strftime` and `strptime`; buffered stdio and `printf`; threads, mutexes, condition variables and keys, with `tests/c/thread/on_ferrix.c` ready as a static threaded program for `CLONE_THREAD`; `dirent.h` and `getopt`; mounts, file system statistics and `mntent.h`; sockets and the address conversions, System V IPC, and Linux's own process and system calls; `termios.h`; `system`, `popen`, temporary files, `realpath`, the `execl` family and `daemon`; the user, group and shadow databases; `syslog.h`, and `utmpx.h` with musl's empty records; the `scanf` family. In progress: `glob` and `regex`, thread cancellation and semaphores, the math library |

## The path to the goal, in order

The goal is `rustc` on Ferrix (stage 16). Everything below is on its path and
is ordered by what blocks what. A row's owner is the session; "open" means
nobody has it yet.

### P0 — blocks the next stage or the goal

| Item | Owner | Why it is P0 |
|---|---|---|
| Threads: `clone(CLONE_VM\|CLONE_THREAD\|CLONE_SETTLS)` and everything a thread implies. In: a `Thread` per task, signal state split between process and thread, `exit` apart from `exit_group` with release on the last thread, and `clone(CLONE_THREAD)` (ferrousli's static pthread test passes on x86-64). Left: signals, stop, `kill` and `execve` across threads (5 points; `execve` answers `EAGAIN` with more than one live thread until then); the futex lock kind, the TLB and `munmap` race and the `brk`-vs-fork race (3); `/proc` threads and the exit test on three architectures (4) | threads (os-9f) | `rustc` is threaded; the largest missing piece on the roadmap. Exit test: a static musl Rust `std::thread` program under `test-shell` on all three architectures |
| File-backed `mmap`: a file mapping maps the inode's own VMO pages, shared and private, with faults served from them. In order: (1) the VMO reverse map with scoped shootdown, landed; (2) `libs/vfs`'s `PageSource` over tmpfs, with no open file's lock held across an inode call, landed; (3) the kernel VMO filling from a source, landed ahead of the mappings because stage 11's kernel mount needs only it; (4) file mappings on it: `MAP_SHARED` writing through, with `msync`, `SIGBUS` past the end and the boot check both ways, landed; (5) `MAP_PRIVATE` copying into a shadow object of its own on first write (reads served from the file's VMO until then, since a file's VMO has shared mappers and `Vmo::attach` refuses a private one beside them), and a boot check that a private write stays out of the file and a file write shows through until the page is copied | ferrix-e6; mm reviewer for the space.rs half | A private file mapping answers `ENODEV` today; `rustc` and the linker map rlibs. Same interface as the btrfs page cache; stage 11's kernel mount needed only (3), and `rustc` needs (4) and (5) |
| Ring-3 virtio-blk reading sectors: `devmgr` (its kernel half is on develop: `device_info`, `device_quiesce`, START and bus mastering at the first pin; the program waits on the native runtime); the block ring's kernel side is on develop up to a published disk (the devfs node from HELLO); a sector read through the ring by a fake driver on `ferrix-rt` in the boot check, then the virtio-blk driver process on `ferrix-rt` reading sectors through a translated domain | ferrix-d9, with ferrix-61 | Stage 11's mount and exit wait on it; the customer declined a kernel-side disk path |
| The out-of-domain probe on x86-64 under KVM on a loaded host, once in a few boots: VT-d's single fault record holds a fault other than the probe's (its stream, page or type differ), so the probe reports nothing and `test-boot` refuses the boot. Seen by os-94 on develop dc010db (1 of 5 loaded KVM boots; log `~/.local/share/ferrix/logs/frames-bisect/dc010db-4.log`) and by os-5b on ce38ee3 at load 12. The probe now prints the record's stream, page and type when they mismatch. Next: loop loaded KVM boots to read the record, then decide whether it is stale from the entropy request, a read where a write was expected, or another function's | os-5b | It can fail main's verification, as FX-1001 could |

### P1 — required before a stage is called done

| Item | Owner | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| Trusting a BAR firmware placed but did not enable | ferrix-d9 | 10 |
| btrfs: CI Miri step for `libs/btrfs` and `libs/block` under 15 minutes, whole-image tests ignored under Miri | ferrix-61 | 11 |
| A two-last-threads exit check that provably races: spin-meet on two processors, with its negative control -- the old last-thread decision put back -- failing by name. Today's check passes that control too, so it shows only that such a process ends with its first thread's status (from stage 9's review of threads commit 4). 1 point | threads (os-9f) | 7 |
| End-to-end user programs for what the `sigpaths` check proves at the kernel's decision: a `SIGSEGV` caught on the alternate stack, and a read interrupted by a handler and restarted under `SA_RESTART` (`SA_RESTART` and the driven signal paths have landed) | ferrix-a5 | 7; `rustc` needs `SIGSEGV` on the alternate stack |
| Retire the 20 ms console polling. Receive by interrupt into a 4 KiB ring has landed on all three: the PL011, the STM32 USART (through ST's EXTI on the DK1), and x86-64's 16550 through an I/O APIC input found from the MADT, with `console::input::{waiters, has_input}` for the console thread to wait on. Left: the console thread and readers waiting on it instead of sleeping (in `fs/terminal.rs`) | ferrix-a5 | 7, 15 |
| `AF_UNIX` names and descriptor passing, the two landings after socket pairs: `bind`, `listen`, `accept`, `connect` over a listener table keyed by inode, abstract names included; then `SCM_RIGHTS` with the in-flight cycle pass, and `SO_PASSCRED` credentials. Carried from landing 1's review: cap a receive's kernel buffer at the receive capacity (`MSG_WAITALL` in chunks of it), drop a refused file outside the `FdTable` lock before descriptors travel, `SO_SNDBUFFORCE`/`SO_RCVBUFFORCE` needing `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and skipping the cap, and Linux's error order in `sendmsg` and `socketpair`. On the compositor's path (stage 17) as well as POSIX's | os-b6, fd/VFS half reviewed by os-c4 | 7, 17 |
| POSIX.1-2024 interface sweep: from musl's implementation of every mandatory POSIX.1-2024 function, the list of Linux system calls (and flags) they need; the stage 7 sweep tooling runs each on all three architectures and files every `ENOSYS`, `EINVAL` on a mandatory flag, or wrong result with the area that owns it, as rows here. Sockets and threads are known and excluded; the `epoll`, `eventfd`, `timerfd` and `signalfd` families are in scope because stage 17 needs them | os-b6, after `AF_UNIX` and the terminal switch | 7, 8, 17 |
| `memfd_create` with `F_ADD_SEALS`/`F_GET_SEALS`, on tmpfs, after file-backed `mmap`: `wl_shm` is a sealed memfd both sides map | os-c4, after the chain | 8, 17 |

### P2 — quality and performance, on the "fast" half of the goal

| Item | Owner |
|---|---|
| The cost of the 20 µs one-shot armed on every wake onto the caller's processor, measured on pipe and futex paths | ferrix-34 |
| Per-CPU frame and heap caches, deferred since stage 2 | open, once a workload can measure them |
| ASIDs and PCIDs, so a switch stops invalidating every user entry | open, after threads |
| `getrandom` seeded from virtio-rng into a real generator; a real-time clock read from the RTC and `/dev/rtc` | open |
| The debt the roadmap names: fuzz targets for `virtio`, `linux-abi` | open |
| The host-test table in the roadmap generated from `cargo test --list` with a gate, instead of counted by hand | ferrix-24 |
| Zero-copy block reads: pin the page-cache pages themselves as the block ring's buffers, removing the data-VMO and scratch copies of stage 11's first read path (ARCHITECTURE §3) | ferrix-61, after stage 11's kernel mount |
| ferrousli's busybox beyond the gates' applets: the 30 stubs in `ferrousli/src/stubs.rs` (regex for `grep` and `sed` patterns busybox does not handle itself, the math functions `awk` calls, name resolution with interface and Ethernet lookups), each ending the program when an applet reaches it; and `crypt`'s traditional DES and `$2*$` blowfish hashes, which return `"*"` | open |

### P3 — hardware variants and later stages, unowned

* GICv3 and its redistributors, with a second AArch64 boot configuration
  (`gic-version=3`); x2APIC; TSC-deadline. Real AArch64 hardware is GICv3.
* Networking, placed after stage 11: sockets, the net core, virtio-net.
* Stage 12 (btrfs write), 13 (namespaces, cgroups, seccomp), 14 (real-time
  domains). Stage 13 also carries global page-cache reclaim and an OOM kill,
  which `rustc` on a small machine needs and no stage names today.
* `/sys`, `/dev/rtc`, tmpfs `FS_IOC_GETFLAGS`: with stage 13's cgroupfs, the
  RTC driver, and never, respectively.
* `vfork` sharing memory rather than copying it.
* Huge pages; frame share and release are order 0 by design.

---

## Decisions

Dated, newest first. A decision here is final until the customer says otherwise.

* **2026-09-14** The busybox built against ferrousli is the primary busybox:
  the userland Ferrix is measured with, first in every `test-shell` and
  `test-vfs` the gates run. The musl and glibc busyboxes stay required as
  compatibility checks. A `ferrousli/` landing rebuilds it and runs both with
  it. This carries out the customer's 2026-09-13 order below once the binary
  passed both, at 5e9b0b6 with no stub reached.

* **2026-09-13 (customer)** `develop` is the landing branch and may be unstable;
  `main` moves only to a verified `develop` commit. Set up at 8342362.
* **2026-09-13 (customer)** Order of everything: first a working `main`, second
  ferrousli on the build with busybox rebuilt against it, third being surer
  that `main` is stable before it moves. This supersedes the earlier
  decision that ferrousli sits beside the roadmap: it now has a P0 row and
  its busybox is a `test-shell` target.

* **2026-09-13** Ferrousli is beside the roadmap, not on it: the goal's path is
  static musl, and ferrousli counts toward no stage. A landing touching only
  `ferrousli/` needs no boots. Its pthread tests become the first foreign
  threaded program once `CLONE_THREAD` exists.
* **2026-09-13** Stage 10's exit criterion requires the out-of-domain DMA fault
  on x86-64 and AArch64 only; ARMv7-A's virtio-pci runs in degraded trusted
  mode because U-Boot forces the SMMU bypass. A ring-3 driver reading sectors
  through an untranslated domain may land so stage 11 can proceed, but stage
  10 is not done until domains translate and the fault is shown.
* **2026-09-13** Stage 11's read stage refuses a volume with a log tree, with a
  clear message; log replay is stage 12's. The default subvolume, data
  checksums and a node cache are required before stage 11 is done.
* **2026-09-13** The page-cache interface, agreed between stages 8 and 11: a
  `PageSource` in `libs/vfs` with `fill_range(first, pages)` filling at least
  one page, stopping at an extent boundary, zeros past the file's size, called
  under no lock and allowed to block; a checksum failure is `EIO`, never a
  zeroed page; the kernel VMO allocates first, fills with no lock held and
  inserts only if the page is still absent; `read` reports `EIO` and a fault
  `SIGBUS`. Eviction and writeback are stage 12's. Order: the VMO reverse
  map, then `PageSource` with tmpfs over it, then file-backed `mmap`.
* **2026-09-13** A ring-3 driver serving a disk must never fault on a file
  mapping of that disk, or it waits on its own completion: its image and data
  come from initramfs, tmpfs, anonymous or ring VMOs, or are committed before
  any pivot onto btrfs. Stage 10's `devmgr` enforces it.
* **2026-09-13** The page cache is the inode's VMO, on tmpfs and on btrfs
  alike, and file-backed `mmap` and `read` share its pages. One interface,
  agreed between the stage 8 and stage 11 owners before either writes it.
* **2026-09-13** No doc gate compares quoted boot lines with a live log; they
  are illustrations and the roadmap says the numbers move. The host-test table
  becomes a generated document with a gate instead.
* **2026-09-13** CI's 120 s boot timeout stays. A quiet boot takes about 10 s;
  local runs on a loaded host use `--timeout 600`.
* **2026-09-13** (customer, relayed) Drivers stay in ring 3; no interim
  kernel-side disk path, even as a test harness.

---

## Waiting on the customer

* A USB-C unplug and replug per DK1 run: every run ends in PSCI `SYSTEM_OFF`,
  after which the reset button does nothing, and the ST-LINK's voltage sense
  and SWD are blind under this firmware, so the host cannot restart the board
  either. Stages 1–9 and `test-shell`'s script ran on it at `fd4442e`; typing
  and the UART drain were proven on it with `uart-rx`. The tag rerun on main,
  and the paste test of interrupt-driven receive, each need one more power
  cycle.
* The root filesystem: 1.7 TB of the 1.9 TB is outside Ferrix. The sessions
  can only keep their own build output down.
* Pushes to `origin`: local `main` is 60 commits ahead, and the last CI runs
  there failed in the Ubuntu test job before today's landings.

---

## Wind-down of 2026-09-13, about 17:00

Every session was asked to stop, commit and hand off. `main` is ec549f2,
verified whole (five boots, KVM, both busyboxes, test-vfs) and tagged
`stage-9.1-console-and-iommu`; `develop` is ahead of it by the stage 4
contended-count rounds (9f6a590, full row plus KVM by its owner), the FX-1001
row and the btrfs node cache. All branches and tags are on origin. Branches
with unlanded work, each committed and pushed, base and state as handed off:

* `board-reset-3c`: landed with proof B on the board (`exit 7` under `ferrix.onexit=reset` reset to U-Boot with no hand at it). Left: reading the option from a `CMDLINE.TXT` on the card, so it survives a reset without `saveenv`, and `test-boot --reset`, which boots with the option and requires QEMU to show a reset rather than a power-off.
* `stage10-ring` (32d29fb, WIP, never compiled): the block ring's kernel side; rebase onto c9677b7, drop the picked commits, wire the module and the native call, use the registry, write `user/blkring-check` on the runtime, full row.
* `worktree-agent-a16ff91583057388b` (24da536): virtio-blk library; Miri and fuzz passed; needs rebase and the full row.
* `worktree-agent-a102cb3140653d102` (f540994): native user-space runtime and `user/`; needs rebase and the full row.
* `worktree-agent-a317dadb0a679f86d` (5e5037a): the QEMU test disk; full row passed on a39ffe1; needs rebase and a go.
* `stage11-kernel-mount-design` (101dcd2): the approved design, draft 5, parked as a document.
* Stage 7 branches, all on origin: `stage7-startup-argument` (19f9171; b0ae3e2 passed the full row, the WIP StartClaim and `exec::load_native` on top are unverified; reviewer ferrix-4b), `stage7-init-pid1` (43e6b6c; rebase over `BUILT_IN_EXE`, then the row and a `sh -i` showing `$$`=1), `worktree-agent-aa758de17bccf6283` (2de6e28, the leak regression check; rebase and row), `worktree-agent-aa734e4c2fcfdceec` (8824e09, SA_RESTART and the signal-path boot check; three boots, KVM, both busyboxes and test-vfs still to run; SIGSEGV on the alternate stack still wants an end-to-end user program), `stage7-uname-ferrix` (72695f1, unverified: the customer chose `uname -s` = `Ferrix`; ferrousli's identity test and any config.guess-style build must follow). Not started: the terminal switch to `console::input`, threads (design in that session's memory; ferrousli's pthread test is ready).
* A lead from stage 7's sweep tooling (`enosys-sweep`, `worktree-agent-aa3e651b1a5027598`, neither for landing): the single-processor `timeout -s KILL` hang did not reproduce in 7 runs on current main; but a sweep kernel on armv7a `--smp 1` fails stage 8's pipes check 4 of 4 with one frame leaked while plain test-boot passes, logs in that session's scratchpad `hang/`; owner stage 8 or mm.
* Stage 9 (`ferrix-4b`): the interrupt wake (verified on fd4442e), process observers, `vmo_map` on the reverse map.
* mm (`ferrix-e5`): x86-64 IST branch (afb3041, row green but for one FX-1001 hit, since root-caused and fixed in stage 10's probe), mprotect invalidation with the COW and MAP_SHARED checks, Miri and fuzz branch (c660bc7). The frame window has no `expect_heap_quiet`: it returns with its first caller, once stage 9's delivery firers and the console stop moving the heap inside a window; until then every report prints the heap's live bytes as a clue, and small-object teardown is proven with a `Weak` that must fail to upgrade.
* ferrousli (`ferrix-ce`): 154 symbols were undefined at busybox's first link. Area 1, the system-call wrappers, is on develop, and the 31 names areas 5-7 may leave as stubs are in `ferrousli/src/stubs.rs`. termios (area 2), area 4, and area 3 but `crypt` are on develop too. Before busybox links, 1 symbol: `crypt` (area 3). The unlanded `ferrousli-threads` branch has its own `src/sched.rs`, which must merge into develop's when it lands.
* FX-1001 on AArch64, the one known intermittent on `main` at the wind-down, was the out-of-domain probe reading the used ring after the device's completion and the event queue from before it; QEMU completes a refused write through a bounce buffer it then drops. Fixed in the probe (stage 10's roadmap section says how); no row remains.
* Open questions for the customer: none. The board is powered at the U-Boot prompt with 95884cd on the card.
