# Ferrix — releases

Each testable milestone on `main` is an annotated tag, verified by the product
owner before tagging as `docs/BACKLOG.md`'s *Milestones* rule says. The notes
here are the tag's, kept short: what a person can try, and what is known not
to work yet. Newest first.

## stage-11.1-network-display-and-threads — 2026-09-16, features at a89aeb25

Two days of the fleet landing on `main` directly: a network that works, a
colour on the screen from a Linux program, threads finished, ferrousli
most of the way through POSIX.1-2024, and the first ports.

- **Networking, exit met.** A net core beside the block core: `AF_INET` and
  `AF_INET6` TCP and UDP, raw IPv4 and IPv6 sockets (`ping`, `ping6`),
  `AF_PACKET` (`udhcpc` gets a lease), `AF_NETLINK` route sockets (`ip`
  configures `eth0`), `/proc/net` rendered as Linux prints it, and a
  virtio-net driver in ring 3 started by `devmgr`. `xtask` carries its own
  gateway over loopback UDP, so `run --net` reaches the network on every
  host, Windows included, and `cargo xtask test-net` runs thirteen programs
  on all three architectures, hermetically.
- **`AF_UNIX`** sockets with path and abstract names and descriptor passing
  over `SCM_RIGHTS`; Wayland's transport.
- **Threads, done.** Signals, stops and `execve` across a process's threads,
  the futex lock kind with the `munmap`/`brk` races closed,
  `/proc/<pid>/task`, and a Rust `std::thread`/`Mutex`/`mpsc` program
  printing `threads: all ok` on all three architectures under
  `cargo xtask test-threads`. A static PIE loads at a base of its own, so
  `rustc`'s default x86-64 binary runs unchanged.
- **Files and users.** `memfd_create` with seals; file permissions checked
  against the caller's credentials, ownership of what a process makes, the
  root-only calls refused to others, and set-user-id programs running as
  their owner.
- **Display, iteration 1.** A display core takes a ring-3 virtio-gpu
  driver's card and publishes `/dev/dri/card0` with the legacy DRM subset a
  software compositor uses; `cargo xtask run --arch x86_64 --display --init
  blank` puts a colour on the screen from a Linux program, checked pixel by
  pixel on x86-64 and AArch64. The firmware framebuffer stays a panic's.
- **The event loop's calls.** `epoll` (level, edge, one-shot, a set inside a
  set), `eventfd2`, and `ioctl(FIONBIO)` on every file: iteration 2's kernel side, done. Input is designed in `docs/INPUT.md` as evdev over a
  ring-3 virtio-input driver, with the ABI probe and the virtio-input
  protocol landed.
- **The compositor's first crates:** the `hyprland.conf` parser and
  Hyprland's layout and dispatcher core, host-tested and fuzzed.
- **ferrousli** answers 996 of POSIX.1-2024's 1243 interfaces (247 missing, none
  stubbed): the whole double and float `<math.h>`, `<fenv.h>`, regex and
  libgen, barriers, semaphores, scheduling calls and C11 `<threads.h>`,
  `<search.h>`, `glob`, the wide-character I/O families, name resolution
  and the netdb databases, atomics, `assert.h`. Its busybox is what every
  gate runs, rebuilt by `cargo xtask busybox` when stale, natively on
  Windows too.
- **zinc,** the zsh-compatible shell in Rust, is in every initramfs with a
  line editor and tab completion, runs zsh scripts and sources oh-my-zsh's setup, and completes commands, files, parameters and users the zsh way (`/bin/zinc`, also `/bin/zsh`).
- **Ports:** curl (HTTP, with mbedTLS built in) and btop, both built against
  ferrousli, are in every x86-64 image: fetch files by name or byte-exact,
  and watch CPU, memory, network and processes live on the console.
  Programs over 4 MiB now start, `/proc/<pid>/mounts` exists, and
  ferrousli gained thread cancellation and what libc++ needs. HTTPS is
  not usable yet: it waits on the firmware clock and a seeded `getrandom`.
- **Windows parity:** `xtask` on Windows runs `run --net`, `run` under WHPX,
  the ferrousli gate and ARMv7-A U-Boot through WSL, `watch-serial` and
  `flash`; gates for landings run on the Linux host over ssh.
- **Decisions of record:** the customer holds the product-owner seat and
  landings go to `main` directly at stable points, each gated on the Linux
  host; the architecture stays what it is, with dynamic linking staged
  behind it; input is evdev over virtio-input; stage 17 is 74 points, 18 is
  96.

Known limits, each with a backlog row:

- `poll`, `ppoll` and `epoll` waits recheck every 5 ms rather than waking on
  the event; `EPOLLRDHUP` and `EPOLLPRI` are never reported; a zero-length
  `eventfd` write returns 0, not `EINVAL`.
- `AF_UNIX`: a socket passed over its own connection is never freed (no
  cycle pass); `SCM_CREDENTIALS` and `SO_PASSCRED` are `EOPNOTSUPP`;
  `MSG_PEEK` on a message carrying descriptors installs none; `sendto`
  with an address on a datagram socket is `EOPNOTSUPP`.
- Threads: `set*id` changes credentials for every thread, a written
  deviation; a thread's `comm` is its process's; the two-last-threads
  exit check does not provably race.
- `card0` is legacy DRM only, one exclusive master, no atomic commit, no
  planes or properties yet (E4), no input devices yet (input L3–L7).
- `timerfd` and `signalfd` do not exist; dynamic linking (`PT_INTERP`) does
  not; the display does not run on ARMv7-A's QEMU machine.
- Stage 10's VT-d stale-record intermittent (P0, reproduced once under
  load) and BAR trust are open; FX-0701, a stop across threads, has a lead.
- The musl busybox's `su` has never worked, and is not a regression; its
  `nc` has no `-U`. The ferrousli busybox is the one to use.

What to test:

```
cargo xtask test-net --arch x86_64 --init ferrousli
cargo xtask run --arch x86_64 --net --init ferrousli
cargo xtask run --arch x86_64 --display --init blank
cargo xtask test-threads --arch all
cargo xtask test-vfs --arch aarch64 --init ferrousli
```

## stage-11-ring-3-disk-and-btrfs — 2026-09-14

Stages 10 and 11 done: a user-mode disk driver behind the IOMMU, and btrfs
read through it; threads begun; ferrousli's busybox as the userland.

- Stage 10's exit: `/sbin/blk`, a virtio-blk driver running in ring 3 on the
  native runtime, serves the disk through the block ring with VT-d (x86-64)
  and the SMMUv3 (AArch64) translating its DMA, a deliberate out-of-domain
  write faults, and a driver's death resets its device before any pinned
  frame is freed. ARMv7-A runs its driver in degraded trusted mode, as
  decided. `FERRIX-BOOT-OK stages 1-10`.
- Stage 11's exit: an image made by real `mkfs.btrfs` is mounted read-only
  at `/mnt` through that driver and 101 files, 17 directories and a link
  read back byte for byte on all three architectures, with every data sector
  checked against the checksum tree and the default subvolume honoured.
  `FERRIX-BOOT-OK stages 1-11`.
- The page cache is the inode's VMO on tmpfs and btrfs alike: files fill
  from a page source, and `mmap` of a file with `MAP_SHARED` maps those pages
  — writes go both ways, `msync` answers, a touch past the end is `SIGBUS`.
  The VMO reverse map takes a VMO's pages out of every space that maps them
  before their frames go back, shooting down only where they may be cached.
- Threads have begun: every task has a thread with signal state of its own,
  `exit` ends a thread apart from `exit_group`, and `clone(CLONE_THREAD)` is
  on `develop` running ferrousli's pthread test.
- Native process creation: `process_create` and `process_start`, `vmo_map`,
  process observers, and a start argument on entry; `devmgr`'s kernel half.
- `SA_RESTART`, pid 1 with orphans reparented, a program killed by its own
  fault no longer panics the kernel, `uname -s` says `Ferrix`.
- All three architectures take console input by interrupt (x86-64's COM1
  through the I/O APIC); ARMv7-A boots with 2 GiB; `ferrix.onexit=reset`
  returns the DK1 to U-Boot with no hand at it — proven on the board, with
  the flash-from-Windows procedure in the board guide.
- Every frame-counted self-check nets heap pages against free frames and
  names the route of any mismatch; the interrupt line frees at its last
  handle's close; the wake check counts wakes rather than timing them.
- ferrousli: its busybox links (from 154 undefined symbols to none) and is
  the primary busybox the gates run — `test-shell` and `test-vfs` pass with
  it on Ferrix, with the musl and glibc busyboxes kept as compatibility
  checks. `cargo xtask busybox` builds it; `--init ferrousli` runs it.
- Decisions of record: POSIX.1-2024 compatibility is a goal, Linux winning
  where they differ; the goal after `rustc` is a Hyprland-shaped compositor
  in Rust (stages 17–19); estimates are story points.
- Known limits: no `AF_UNIX` sockets yet (landing 1 of 3 is verified on
  `develop`), no `MAP_PRIVATE` file mappings, no `devmgr` program (the boot
  check starts the driver), one open lead on ARMv7-A at one processor.

What to test:

```
cargo xtask busybox
cargo xtask run --arch x86_64 --init ferrousli
cargo xtask test-vfs --arch x86_64 --init ferrousli
cargo xtask test-boot --arch armv7a --memory 2048 --smp 2
```

## stage-9.1-console-and-iommu — 2026-09-13, commit 5fb365f

Arm console input, translated IOMMU domains, and the day's intermittent
failures fixed.

- Typed input works on the Arm machines: the PL011 and STM32 USART receive,
  proven on the STM32MP157D-DK1 (the first keystroke read on hardware), and
  the console drains before power-off so the last line arrives whole.
- glibc programs run as init: `/proc/self/exe` is absolute, so Ubuntu's
  static busybox reaches its prompt
  (`FERRIX_INIT=/usr/bin/busybox cargo xtask run --arch x86_64`).
- Stage 10: VT-d on x86-64 and SMMUv3 on AArch64 translate every device's
  DMA, an out-of-domain write is caught by the unit's fault record, a driver
  can pin VMO pages for its device, and IOMMU waits run with interrupts on.
- Stage 11, host side: btrfs reads verify every data sector against the
  checksum tree, honour the default subvolume and parse `INODE_EXTREF`.
- Fixed: unmount left a dentry per mount cycle (stage 8 frame-count
  failures); frame counts raced the reaper (stages 6 and 8); the preemption
  count could be raised on one processor and lowered on another (FX-0503); a
  new task was not charged before an insert (FX-0701); frame 0 was handed out
  under OVMF (a root-table panic under KVM).
- ferrousli is on the build path: `cargo xtask check --ferrousli` runs its
  gates, CI runs them, and busybox builds against it from pinned sources (the
  link still wants 154 functions).
- Verified on the STM32MP157D-DK1 on 2026-09-13, 21:25–21:31, flashed by hand
  from Windows (U-Boot `ums`, the three files checked by hash): stages 1–9,
  the console receiving by interrupt 84, `test-shell`'s script typed line by
  line, a 1000-character paste arriving whole, and the final line draining
  whole before power-off.
- Known limits: no threads, no file-backed `mmap`, no ring-3 disk driver yet;
  the interrupt-driven console and reboot-to-U-Boot are on `develop`.

What to test:

```
cargo xtask run --arch armv7a --init '~/.local/share/ferrix/busybox/{arch}/bin/busybox.static'
FERRIX_INIT=/usr/bin/busybox cargo xtask run --arch x86_64
```

Type at the `ferrix#` prompt on the Arm machine; the second starts Ubuntu's
glibc busybox as init on x86-64.

## stage-9 — 2026-09-13, commit 80d0ea7

Stages 1–9 done, every known stage 5 and 6 intermittent failure fixed.

- Boots from UEFI firmware (EDK2, U-Boot) into a Rust kernel on x86-64,
  AArch64 and ARMv7-A; the boot marker reads `FERRIX-BOOT-OK stages 1-9`.
- Memory: buddy allocator, slab heap, guard-paged vmap arena, demand paging,
  copy-on-write fork, W^X sweep, boot memory reclaimed.
- Traps, interrupts and time on every architecture; SMP with every vCPU
  online, IPIs, TLB shootdown, grace periods.
- EEVDF fair scheduler with load tracking, placement, affinity and balancing.
- User mode and the Linux syscall ABI: `fork`, `vfork`, `execve`, `wait4`,
  pipes, `futex`, signal delivery with `sigreturn`, a terminal with job control
  and Ctrl-C, about 150 calls answered.
- Static musl busybox runs a script and an interactive shell on all three
  architectures.
- On hardware, verified after the tag at `fd4442e`: an STM32MP157D-DK1 at two
  cores reaches `FERRIX-BOOT-OK stages 1-9` and runs `test-shell`'s script.
  Known defect: the last console line before power-off is cut, because the
  STM32 USART driver does not wait for its transmitter to drain.
- VFS with tmpfs, devfs, procfs and initramfs; `ls -R /proc`,
  `cat /proc/self/maps` and a forking shell script pass; `top`, `ps`, `mpstat`
  run.
- Native ABI: handles, channels with handle passing, ports, jobs, VMOs,
  `Interrupt` and `IoMapping` objects for ring-3 drivers.
- Stage 10 under way: PCI enumeration, device nodes, MSI-X vectors, virtio-rng
  driven by DMA with an MSI-X completion, VT-d translating on x86-64.
- Known limits: no threads, no file-backed `mmap`, no disk yet, console input
  only on x86-64.

What to test:

```
cargo xtask test-boot  --arch all
cargo xtask test-shell --arch all --init '~/.local/share/ferrix/busybox/{arch}/bin/busybox.static'
cargo xtask test-vfs   --arch all --init '~/.local/share/ferrix/busybox/{arch}/bin/busybox.static'
FERRIX_INIT=~/.local/share/ferrix/busybox/x86_64/bin/busybox.static cargo xtask run --arch x86_64
```

The last gives an interactive busybox shell on the serial console; type after
the prompt appears.
