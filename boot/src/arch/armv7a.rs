//! The ARMv7-A end of the loader.
//!
//! AArch64's sequence, in coprocessor 15's spelling. Firmware hands over in
//! SVC mode, usually with the MMU on and short-descriptor tables of its own,
//! and the architecture no more permits switching `TTBCR.EAE` under a live
//! translation regime than AArch64 permits reprogramming `TCR_EL1`. So the
//! loader cleans what it wrote out of the caches, turns the MMU off, installs
//! a long-descriptor regime — `MAIR0` and `MAIR1`, `TTBCR` with `EAE` set,
//! and the two 64-bit table base registers — and turns it back on. Firmware's
//! identity map keeps the program counter meaning the same thing throughout,
//! exactly as it does there.
//!
//! One thing has no AArch64 counterpart. The kernel half is translated
//! through `TTBR1` with `TTBCR.T1SZ = 1`, whose level-1 table is two entries
//! indexed by address bit 30, while `libs/paging` indexes the same root by
//! bits 31:30 and so puts `0x8000_0000` in entry 2. `TTBR1` therefore holds
//! the root's address plus sixteen — what Linux calls `TTBR1_OFFSET` — and a
//! test in `libs/paging` pins the half of that arithmetic that lives there.
