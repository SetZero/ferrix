//! Harder than its x86-64 counterpart for one reason: firmware hands over with
//! the MMU already **on**, and the architecture does not permit reprogramming
//! `TCR_EL1` underneath a live translation regime. So the sequence is to clean
//! what we wrote out of the caches, turn the MMU off, install our own regime,
//! and turn it back on — which works only because UEFI identity maps the
//! loader, so the program counter means the same thing either way.
//!
