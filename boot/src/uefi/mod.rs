//! Just enough UEFI to load a kernel.
//!
//! Hand-written rather than pulled from a crate, for the reason the workspace
//! manifest gives: this is the code that runs before anything else exists, and
//! the subset it needs — a memory map, a file, a framebuffer and a way to say
//! goodbye to firmware — is small enough to read in one sitting.
//!
//! Every structure here is `repr(C)` and its fields are declared **in the order
//! the specification gives, including the ones we never call**. A missing
//! function pointer does not fail to compile; it silently shifts every field
//! after it, and the symptom is calling `free_pool` when you meant
//! `get_memory_map`.
//!
//! Reference: UEFI Specification 2.10.
