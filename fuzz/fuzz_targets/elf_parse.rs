//! Fuzz the ELF64 reader.
//!
//! This is the sharpest surface in the tree that takes bytes somebody else
//! chose. Today the loader parses the kernel with it; from stage 6 the kernel
//! parses *user programs* with it, which means an attacker picks every byte and
//! the parse happens in ring 0 with nothing above it to contain a mistake.
//!
//! The contract being fuzzed is total: for **any** input, every accessor either
//! answers or returns an error. It must never panic, never index out of bounds,
//! never overflow, and never read outside the slice it was given.
//! `libs/elf` is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, so a memory-safety bug here would
//! have to be a compiler bug — what this actually hunts is the panic, which in
//! a kernel is just as fatal.
