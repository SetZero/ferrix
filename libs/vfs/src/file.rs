//! Open file descriptions.
//!
//! What `open` returns is not a descriptor: it is a *description*, which the
//! descriptor number refers to. The difference is observable and programs
//! depend on it. Two descriptors made by `dup`, or inherited across `fork`,
//! share one description and therefore one offset — which is how a shell's
//! `(echo a; echo b) > file` writes both lines rather than the second over
//! the first. Two separate `open`s of the same file do not share one. The
//! close-on-exec flag, by contrast, belongs to the descriptor, and lives in
//! [`crate::fd::FdTable`].
//!
//! # The offset is held across I/O, and it is a lock that sleeps
//!
//! A filesystem that reads a disk sleeps, so no spin lock of the description
//! is held across a call into the [`Inode`]: the status flags are read out
//! from under theirs first. The offset is different. `read`, `write` and a
//! directory listing take it and hold it across the I/O, so that two reads
//! racing on one description get consecutive bytes rather than the same
//! ones, and the offset ends where the last I/O ended, in order. That is
//! Linux's `f_pos_lock`, since 3.14. It can be held across a sleep because
//! it is a [`ferrix_sync::SleepLock`], whose waiters sleep on what the
//! kernel lent the mount the file was opened on (see [`crate::Mount::parker`]);
//! on the host they spin.
//!
//! A stream never takes it: a read may wait for another program, and a
//! second reader of the same pipe must not wait behind it for a lock that
//! guards nothing. `pread` and `pwrite` never take it either, since they
//! leave the position alone, so a program that shares a descriptor between
//! threads and wants no ordering at all has those.
//!
//! An `O_APPEND` write is atomic by the filesystem's doing, not the lock's:
//! it decides where the end is under its own lock and returns the offset
//! just past what it wrote, and a `pwrite` under `O_APPEND` appends too.
