//! The buffer behind one direction of a socket, and the rules that make it one.
//!
//! A connected `AF_UNIX` socket is two of these, one each way, and like a pipe
//! almost everything a program relies on happens at the edges rather than in
//! the queue. What a pipe does not have is the two things this adds:
//!
//! * **Records.** A `SOCK_SEQPACKET` or `SOCK_DGRAM` socket delivers each send
//!   as one receive, whole or cut short but never run together with the next,
//!   and a receive into a buffer too small for the record discards the rest
//!   while still able to say how long it was, which is what `MSG_TRUNC`
//!   reports. A `SOCK_STREAM` socket has no boundaries, and this buffer joins
//!   consecutive writes into one segment so a stream of one-byte writes is not
//!   a segment per byte.
//! * **Ancillary data.** An `SCM_RIGHTS` message rides with the bytes it was
//!   sent with, and belongs to their first byte. Linux treats the socket buffer
//!   that carries one as a boundary even in a stream, and so does this: a read
//!   runs on through plain bytes into bytes that brought descriptors, takes
//!   them, and never runs on past the end of those bytes. So each receive
//!   hands back at most one set, with the bytes it came with and whatever
//!   plain bytes were before them. A caller can name ancillary data a read
//!   that has taken bytes stops before instead
//!   ([`SocketBuffer::stopping_before`]), which the kernel does for
//!   credentials.
//!
//! The ancillary type is a parameter, `A`, because what it holds -- open
//! files, credentials -- is the kernel's, and this crate stays a pure function
//! of bytes that host tests can reach every edge of. That has one consequence
//! the interface is shaped around: dropping an `A` may mean closing a file,
//! and the kernel holds this buffer's lock. So an `A` is never dropped here.
//! [`SocketBuffer::write`] takes it only when it attaches it, and leaves it with
//! the caller otherwise; [`SocketBuffer::read`] returns it;
//! [`SocketBuffer::close_reader`] and [`SocketBuffer::drain`] hand back every
//! one still queued. The caller drops them after unlocking.
//!
//! As in [`crate::pipe`], waiting is not here: every outcome that would block
//! is a value, and the kernel turns it into a sleep or `EAGAIN`. Unlike a
//! pipe's there is no `poll` answer here, because a socket's is not a fact
//! about one buffer: it combines this direction's buffer with the other's, and
//! with a connection state -- listening, connecting, shut down -- that only
//! the kernel has.
