//! The two byte queues a connection holds, and the out-of-order pieces it
//! cannot put in one yet.
//!
//! A TCP connection is two queues and a set of counters. [`ByteQueue`] is the
//! queue: bytes in at one end, bytes out at the other, with a fixed capacity
//! that is what the connection advertises as its window. It is a
//! [`VecDeque`] with a ceiling and an argument for why the ceiling is there --
//! a socket buffer that grows without bound is a machine a stranger can fill.
//!
//! [`Reassembly`] holds what arrived early. A segment that begins past
//! `RCV.NXT` cannot be given to the program, because the bytes before it have
//! not come; it is kept here, trimmed against what is already held, and drained
//! into the receive queue as soon as the gap closes.
