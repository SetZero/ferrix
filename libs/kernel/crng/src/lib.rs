//! The kernel's random number generator: `ChaCha20`, used with fast key
//! erasure.
//!
//! # The generator
//!
//! [`Crng`] holds a 256-bit key and a block counter. Every 64-byte block it
//! computes replaces the key with its first 32 bytes and hands out the other
//! 32. A key read out of memory therefore says nothing about the bytes already
//! handed out: they came from blocks under keys that no longer exist. This is
//! the construction Linux's `crng` and OpenBSD's `arc4random` use, and the
//! reason for it is backtracking resistance, not speed.
//!
//! # Seeding
//!
//! Where the bytes come from is the kernel's business: firmware's random
//! number protocol, a CPU's random instruction, the jitter between two reads
//! of a counter. [`Crng::mix`] folds any of them into the key and then
//! replaces the key with a block computed under it, so each input is spread
//! over the whole key. An input nobody can predict makes the key
//! unpredictable, whatever else was mixed in with it. An input somebody can
//! predict adds nothing, and costs nothing either. [`Crng::credit`] records
//! how many bits of the inputs the caller vouches for, and [`Crng::seeded`]
//! answers whether that reached 256.
//!
//! # Checked against
//!
//! The block function against RFC 8439's own test vector, and against
//! OpenSSL's `chacha20` keystream, including the counter carrying from its
//! low word into its high one.
