//! What a handle permits.
//!
//! Rights live on the *handle*, not on the object. Two handles to one channel
//! can differ — a driver is given a VMO it may map but not write through, or a
//! job it may watch but not kill — and a handle's rights can only ever be
//! reduced: [`Requested::resolve`] refuses anything that is not a subset of
//! what is held. That monotonicity is the whole security argument of a
//! capability system, so it is decided in one function here rather than at
//! each call site in the kernel.
