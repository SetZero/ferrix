//! The hand-off ABI between the UEFI loader and the kernel.
//!
//! These are two separate programs, linked for different targets, that meet at
//! exactly one struct. Both compile it from this one definition, every type is
//! `repr(C)`, and the kernel refuses to start if the magic or version disagree
//! — because the failure mode of a silent layout mismatch is a triple fault
//! with nothing on the serial port to say why.
//!
//! # One layout per word width
//!
//! Where things live in the virtual address space is a [`Layout`], and there
//! are two: [`LAYOUT_64`], which x86-64 and AArch64 share constant for
//! constant, and [`LAYOUT_32`] for ARMv7-A, which cannot hold a single one of
//! them. The crate root re-exports the one matching the target's pointer width
//! under the names the rest of the tree uses, so generic code says
//! [`PHYSMAP_BASE`] and never a width. Both layouts are checked at compile time
//! on every build, and the host tests read both — which is how the 32-bit one
//! is tested by a machine that is not 32-bit.
//!
//! [`BootInfo`] itself has *one* layout on every width. Its addresses are
//! `u64` even where a pointer would be four bytes, so the structure the host
//! tests build is the structure a 32-bit kernel reads.
//!
//! # Reading it safely
//!
//! [`BootInfo`] is a raw structure full of addresses the kernel did not
//! create. Rather than sprinkle `unsafe` over every reader, the kernel
//! validates it once through [`BootInfo::validate`] and works with the
//! resulting [`BootView`], whose accessors are safe.
//!
//! ```
//! # use ferrix_bootinfo::{BootInfo, BootInfoError};
//! # fn example(raw: *const BootInfo) -> Result<(), BootInfoError> {
//! // SAFETY: in the kernel this pointer is the one argument the loader passed.
//! let view = unsafe { (*raw).validate() }?;
//! for region in view.regions() {
//!     let _ = region.kind;
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
