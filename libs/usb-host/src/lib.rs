//! A USB host as logic over registers and DMA memory: an EHCI controller,
//! the hubs behind it, and the keyboards and mice behind those.
//!
//! `user/usbhid` runs this in a ring-3 process under devmgr, for the
//! STM32MP15 DK boards' USB host (`docs/INPUT.md` §7). The process holds an
//! `IoMapping` of the controller's registers, its interrupt, a VMO pinned
//! with `PIN_COHERENT` for the memory the controller walks, and one control
//! channel to the kernel's input core per keyboard or mouse. None of those
//! exist in a unit test, so everything that decides a register value, a
//! descriptor or an event is here, written against [`Registers`], [`Dma`]
//! and [`Clock`], and tested against a model of the controller and of the
//! devices a DK board has on its bus:
//!
//! * [`ehci`]: the controller -- its reset, its two schedules, control
//!   transfers, and interrupt pipes polled every frame;
//! * [`usb`]: the standard requests and descriptors;
//! * [`hub`]: the hub class's requests and port status;
//! * [`hid`]: the boot protocol's reports, and the events and HELLO they make;
//! * [`bus`]: enumeration, hot plugging, and what the driver hands the core.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! Only the boot protocol: a keyboard's or mouse's boot interface, whose
//! report layout the HID specification fixes, so no report descriptor is
//! parsed. Keyboard LEDs, isochronous and bulk transfers, and a full- or
//! low-speed device on a root port -- which EHCI hands to a companion
//! controller -- are not driven.
//!
//! # Waiting
//!
//! A control transfer takes a few frames, and a port reset fifty
//! milliseconds; enumeration waits for both in place, through
//! [`Clock::sleep_nanos`]. Interrupt pipes never wait: the controller
//! completes them in memory, and [`bus::Bus::on_interrupt`] reads what it
//! wrote.
