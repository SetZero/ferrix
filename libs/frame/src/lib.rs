//! A buddy allocator for physical frames.
//!
//! # Why this is pure array manipulation
//!
//! A textbook buddy allocator threads its free lists through the free pages
//! themselves, which means every list operation is a write to physical memory
//! and the whole allocator can only be tested on a machine. This one keeps the
//! links in a side array — one [`PageEntry`] per frame — so allocating and
//! freeing is index arithmetic and nothing else.
//!
//! That is not a trick to make it testable, though it does: the side array has
//! to exist anyway. Copy-on-write needs a refcount per frame, reclaim needs to
//! know which object owns a frame, and neither can live in a page that is
//! currently in use. Linux reaches the same conclusion and calls it `struct
//! page`. Putting the free-list links there too costs nothing and buys a
//! `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` allocator that `cargo test`, Miri and a fuzzer can
//! all drive.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! Blocks are powers of two frames, from one frame up to `2^MAX_ORDER`. A block
//! is split when a smaller one is needed and merged with its buddy when freed,
//! so the free lists stay as coarse as the allocation pattern allows.
//!
//! ```
//! # use ferrix_frame::{Frames, PageEntry, MAX_ORDER};
//! // One entry per frame, for frames 0x100..0x200.
//! let mut entries = [PageEntry::RESERVED; 0x100];
//! let mut frames = Frames::new(&mut entries, 0x100);
//! frames.insert_free(0x100, 0x100);
//!
//! let block = frames.allocate(3).unwrap(); // eight frames
//! assert_eq!(frames.free_frames(), 0x100 - 8);
//! frames.deallocate(block, 3);
