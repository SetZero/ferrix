//! Sockets: the numbers `socket`, `setsockopt` and `sendmsg` take, and the
//! layouts of the structures they pass by pointer.
//!
//! Ferrix's first sockets are `AF_UNIX` ones, because that is what the
//! programs it runs reach for before any network exists: a `socketpair` as a
//! two-way pipe, a daemon's control socket, a descriptor handed from one
//! process to another in an `SCM_RIGHTS` message. So this module is the part
//! of the socket ABI those need, written down once.
//!
//! # One table for three architectures
//!
//! Every option and flag number here is the one in
//! `include/uapi/asm-generic/socket.h`, `linux/socket.h` and `linux/un.h`, and
//! x86-64, AArch64 and ARMv7-A all take the generic socket header unchanged.
//! The architectures that renumber socket options -- alpha, MIPS, PA-RISC and
//! SPARC among them -- are not ones Ferrix runs on, so unlike [`crate::nr`]
//! there is nothing per architecture to fold.
//!
//! # Why two of the layouts are decoders rather than structures
//!
//! Most of [`crate::types`] is `#[repr(C)]` structures the kernel writes out
//! whole, because most of that ABI is the same size on every architecture.
//! `struct msghdr` and `struct cmsghdr` are not: both carry `size_t` fields,
//! so ARMv7-A's are narrower than the 64-bit ones, and no one Rust structure
//! has both layouts. They are given instead as a plain value and functions
//! over little-endian bytes that take the pointer [`Width`] as an argument --
//! a value rather than a `cfg`, so the host tests check the 32-bit layout on a
//! 64-bit machine. Little-endian because all three architectures run that way
//! under Ferrix. [`Ucred`] and [`Linger`] have no pointer-sized field and are
//! `repr(C)` like the rest of the crate.
//!
//! Every decoder answers `None` for a buffer too short to hold what it reads,
//! and every encoder `None` for a buffer too short or a value too wide for a
//! 32-bit word, rather than panicking or truncating: the bytes come from a
//! program, and a short one is that program's mistake to be told about.
