//! Structure layouts and flag constants of the Linux system call ABI.
//!
//! Every structure here is `#[repr(C)]` and matches, byte for byte, what the
//! kernel writes into a user buffer on a 64-bit target. The two architectures
//! agree on everything except `stat` and `epoll_event`, which are given per
//! architecture in [`x86_64`] and [`aarch64`]; the rest is shared, because the
//! generic UAPI headers are what both use.
//!
//! Sizes and field offsets are asserted in this crate's tests rather than
//! trusted. The failure mode of a wrong layout is not a compile error: it is a
//! program that reads a file size out of the padding, and there is nothing in
//! the resulting behaviour that points back at this file.
