//! Scheduling domains and the class stack: which CPUs are scheduled together,
//! and what runs first on them.
//!
//! `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5 partitions the CPUs into domains, each running
//! one of three modes, and gives each mode a stack of scheduling classes that
//! are asked in order for something to run. Stage 5 implements one mode and
//! builds one domain holding every CPU. What it does not do is pretend the
//! others will never exist: the mode is a property of the domain from the
//! first line, the class stack is looked up from the mode rather than written
//! into the scheduler, and the two modes stage 14 will write are named here
//! and refused. When they arrive there is a type to extend and a check to
//! satisfy, rather than a scheduler to take apart to find where the policy
//! was.
