//! ARMv7-A page table descriptor encoding: the Large Physical Address
//! Extension's long-descriptor format, three levels over a 4 KiB granule.
//!
//! Reference: Arm Architecture Reference Manual, ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R edition,
//! section B3.6, "Long-descriptor translation table format".
//!
//! ARMv7-A has two descriptor formats. The short one is 32 bits wide, has two
//! levels and no privileged-execute-never bit; the long one — LPAE — is the
//! format AArch64 went on to adopt nearly bit for bit. Ferrix uses the long
//! one for exactly that reason: what follows is [`super::aarch64`] with two
//! differences, and the memory attributes are the same agreement, split
//! across two registers instead of held in one.
//!
//! The differences:
//!
//! * the output address is 40 bits rather than 48;
//! * bit 54 is `XN`, execute-never at *every* privilege level, where AArch64
//!   has `UXN`, which binds EL0 only. So a mapping the kernel may execute is
//!   one with both `XN` and `PXN` clear, and a user mapping the kernel must
//!   never execute sets `PXN` and leaves `XN` to say what user mode may do.
//!
//! # The walk is three levels
//!
//! A 32-bit input address needs no level 0: the root is a level-1 table of
//! four entries, one per gibibyte, which is [`Encoding::ROOT_LEVEL`]. The
//! kernel's half is translated through `TTBR1` with `TTBCR.T1SZ = 1`, and the
//! hardware then indexes a *two*-entry table by address bit 30 alone — while
//! this crate indexes the root by bits 31:30, putting `0x8000_0000` in entry
//! 2. The two agree when `TTBR1` holds the root's address plus sixteen bytes,
//! which is what the loader writes and why a test pins it.
