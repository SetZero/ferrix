//! The net ring: the memory the kernel shares with a ring-3 network driver,
//! and the rules each side keeps over it.
//!
//! `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 runs drivers in user processes and says the data
//! path to them *"is not per-request IPC. Driver and kernel share a descriptor
//! ring in a VMO and ring a doorbell; requests batch."* `libs/blkring` is that
//! ring for block devices; this is the one for network devices, and
//! `docs/NET-RING.md` is its specification.
//!
//! # Why it is not `libs/blkring` with a different entry
//!
//! A block request carries anything from a sector to a megabyte, so the block
//! ring has an allocator: the kernel picks a `data_offset` for every
//! submission and must not reuse a region before its completion. A frame is
//! bounded by the interface's MTU, so this ring has none. The data VMO is
//! `entries` slots of `slot_bytes`, slot *n* lives at `n * slot_bytes`, and a
//! submission names its slot. That removes the whole region-allocation half of
//! the protocol and with it the class of bug where a region is reused early --
//! which on an untranslated IOMMU domain is a device writing into somebody
//! else's packet.
//!
//! The index discipline below -- private indices, checked reads of the peer's,
//! the want-bell handshake -- is the same discipline `libs/blkring` keeps, and
//! this is a second implementation of it rather than a shared one. That is a
//! deliberate debt with a reason: extracting it would refactor a subsystem
//! that is shipped, fuzzed and on the boot path, in the same landing as a new
//! one. `docs/BACKLOG.md` carries the row.
//!
//! # Objects
//!
//! | Object | Created by | The other side holds it with | Purpose |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | Control channel | devmgr or the kernel | one endpoint each | setup, the device's description, shutdown |
//! | Ring VMO | driver | kernel: exactly `READ \| WRITE \| MAP \| TRANSFER` | header and both entry arrays |
//! | Data VMO | driver, pinned | kernel: exactly `READ \| WRITE \| MAP \| TRANSFER` | the slots, copied through |
//! | Driver port | driver | kernel: exactly `WRITE \| TRANSFER` | submission doorbell |
//! | Kernel completion port | kernel | driver: exactly `WRITE` | completion doorbell |
//!
//! Rights at handoff are exact, for `libs/blkring`'s reason: a `DUPLICATE` on
//! a VMO would let the kernel's handle be copied.
//!
//! # The ring VMO
//!
//! Little-endian on every architecture, no padding, offsets in [`layout`] and
//! asserted by the tests:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0   magic "FXNR"     4   version 1        6   flags, 0 in v1
//! 8   entries          12  slot_bytes
//! 16  sub_offset       20  comp_offset
//! 24  sub_tail         written by the kernel
//! 28  sub_head         written by the driver
//! 32  comp_tail        written by the driver
//! 36  comp_head        written by the kernel
//! 40  sub_want_bell    written by the driver
//! 44  comp_want_bell   written by the kernel
//! 48  reserved, zero, to 64
//!
//! at sub_offset:  entries x 16-byte submissions
//!                 slot 0, length 4, op 8, flags 9, reserved 10
//! at comp_offset: entries x 16-byte completions
//!                 slot 0, length 4, status 8, reserved 12
//! ```
//!
//! `entries` is a power of two in `2..=4096`, and `slot_bytes` a multiple of
//! 64 in `64..=65536`. The driver writes the first six fields before HELLO;
//! the kernel reads them once, in [`KernelSide::attach`], and keeps its own
//! copies. Every other field has the one writer marked. Indices are
//! free-running `u32`s, and the slot for an index is `index & (entries - 1)`.
//!
//! # Trust
//!
//! Neither side trusts the other's writes.
//!
//! * **Private indices.** Each side keeps its own head, tail and want-bell
//!   flag in its own memory and only ever *writes* them to the ring. A peer
//!   scribbling on them moves nothing.
//! * **Every read of a peer's index is checked.** A tail more than `entries`
//!   ahead of this side's head, or an index behind the last value this side
//!   accepted, is [`Corruption`].
//! * **Every entry is checked when it is read.** A slot number past `entries`,
//!   a length past `slot_bytes`, an operation the protocol does not have, a
//!   completion for a slot nobody submitted: each is [`Corruption`], and
//!   corruption is terminal for the side that sees it.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! Ports, mappings, the pinned pages and the device. Those are the kernel's
//! glue and the driver process's business; this crate is the bytes and the
//! arithmetic, so that `cargo test`, Miri and a fuzzer can reach all of it.

/// Nothing here hands an address to anyone: the ring is reached only through

/// correctness. The want-bell handshake is a store on one processor followed
/// by a load, racing a store and a load on another, and it avoids a lost
/// wake-up only if each side's load sees the other side's earlier store. The
/// barrier must be a real ordering fence. An empty barrier is correct only
/// where both sides are stepped one after the other, as in the tests.
