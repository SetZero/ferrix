//! Doorbells: what to ring, and what counts as having rung.
//!
//! The same discipline `libs/blkring`'s doorbells keep, and for the same
//! reason; see this crate's root for why it is a second copy rather than a
//! shared one.
//!
//! Both doorbells are `PACKET_USER` port packets on a port the receiver made
//! and the sender holds with `WRITE` only. Neither side here queues one; a
//! side's `publish` returns the [`Doorbell`] to ring, and the glue rings it
//! with `port_queue` in the driver or `Port::queue_user` in the kernel.
//!
//! Ports are bounded (1024 user packets), so a queue can be refused. A bell is
//! a hint and any number of them counts as one, so a refusal for being full
//! means a bell is already waiting: the call *rang*. [`rung`] and
//! [`port_queue_rung`] turn that into [`Rung::Full`], so neither side's glue
//! treats it as an error.
