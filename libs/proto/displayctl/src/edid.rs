//! A connector's EDID: which file Linux's `drm.edid_firmware=` names for it,
//! whether the file's bytes are an EDID, what the monitor calls itself, and
//! how the card's property calls answer for the blob.
//!
//! `docs/DISPLAY.md` §7 is the design. The short of it: the kernel's display
//! core owns the DRM uAPI, so it is the core that gives a connector its
//! `EDID` property and answers `GETPROPBLOB`, and -- as Linux's DRM core does
//! in `drm_edid_load.c` -- it is the core that reads the file the command line
//! names, from `/lib/firmware`. Nothing here reads a file or a command line;
//! the kernel does, and hands the bytes in.
//!
//! # The grammar, as `drm_load_edid_firmware` reads it
//!
//! `drm.edid_firmware=` is a comma-separated list. An entry `<connector>:<file>`
//! is that connector's; the first whose connector matches is taken. An entry
//! with no colon is every connector's, and the last such is the fallback for a
//! connector no entry names. A connector matches when its name *begins* with
//! the entry's -- Linux compares with `strncmp` over the entry's length, so
//! `DP-1:` is `DP-10`'s too -- and that is kept, since a command line written
//! for Linux has to mean here what it means there. A trailing newline on the
//! name is cut, as there.
//!
//! What is not Linux's: the six built-in EDIDs (`edid/1024x768.bin` and the
//! rest), which Linux has since taken out as well; and the search path,
//! which is `/lib/firmware` alone, with no `updates/` or `firmware_class.path=`.
//!
//! # The bytes, as `edid_load` checks them
//!
//! The file's size must be what its base block says -- 128 bytes for it and
//! for each extension its byte `0x7E` counts. The base block must be valid:
//! at least six of the eight header bytes right (the rest are put right, as
//! `edid_fixup`'s default does), its checksum right, and version 1. An
//! extension block that is not valid is dropped, the blocks after it moved up
//! and the base block's count and checksum made to agree; a CTA-861 block
//! with a wrong checksum is kept, as Linux keeps one.
