//! All of them are stage 9's, owned by ferrix-4b.

//! * **Process creation**, `0x1030` and `0x1031`. The numbers were copied here
//!   while `libs/proto/native-abi`'s table left `0x1030..=0x1037` free for them;
//!   they are on the table now and re-exported from it. The argument lists
//!   are the handler's: `(job, image_vmo, name_ptr, name_len)` and
//!   `(process, bootstrap or 0)`.
//! * **A process's bootstrap and its end**, `0x1032` to `0x1034`: init's K3
//!   and K6 (`docs/INIT.md` §16), `process_give`, `process_bootstrap` and
//!   `process_status`.
//! * **`vmo_map`**, `0x1024`, whose number is on main's table and whose handler
//!   and `MAP_READ`/`MAP_WRITE` constants are not. The constants are copied here
//!   until they land in `libs/proto/native-abi`'s `types`.
