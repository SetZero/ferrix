//! The control plane: HELLO, READY, REFUSED, STOP and STOPPED between the
//! kernel and a driver, and START from `devmgr` to a driver it starts.
//!
//! Every message is a fixed little-endian structure whose first four bytes are
//! its type and next four its length; handles ride in the channel message's
//! handle array, and the glue passes the rights it read off them to
//! [`Hello::validate`] or [`Start::validate`].
//!
//! ```text
//! HELLO    driver -> kernel, 72 bytes, handles [ring VMO, data VMO, driver port]
//!   0 type 1   4 length   8 version u16   10 queues u16   12 block_size u32
//!   16 capacity u64   24 max_sectors u32   28 device_flags u32
//!   32 data_vmo_size u64   40 location u32   44 serial [u8; 20]
//!   64 name [u8; 8]
//! READY    kernel -> driver, 8 bytes, handles [kernel completion port]
//! REFUSED  kernel -> driver, 12 bytes, no handles
//!   8 reason u32, a Refusal
//! STOP     kernel -> driver, 8 bytes
//! STOPPED  driver -> kernel, 8 bytes
//! START    devmgr -> driver, 92 bytes, handles [device, control channel]
//!   8 common Block   24 notify Block   40 isr Block   56 device Block
//!     (a Block: 0 phys u64, 8 offset u32, 12 length u32)
//!   72 notify_off_multiplier u32   76 msix_table_size u16
//!   78 pci_device_id u16   80 location u32   84 name [u8; 8]
//! ```
//!
//! START is the first and only message on a driver's bootstrap channel: the
//! device it is to drive, as `devmgr` read it off the kernel's enumeration,
//! and the driver's end of the ring's control channel `devmgr` made for it.
//! Ring 3 cannot walk configuration space, so START carries where each virtio
//! register block lies in physical memory — the page-aligned start of the
//! pages holding it, inside one of the device's apertures, the block's offset
//! within those pages and its length — which is what `io_mapping_create`
//! takes. A driver handed anything else first exits.
