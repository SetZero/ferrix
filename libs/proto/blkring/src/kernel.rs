//! The kernel's end of the ring: it produces submissions and consumes
//! completions.
//!
//! # Outstanding ids
//!
//! Every submission is remembered until its completion is consumed, in storage
//! the caller provides ([`Slot`]s), because a completion is only as good as the
//! kernel's ability to say which request it answers. An id that is not in the
//! table — never submitted, or already completed — is corruption, never a
//! second answer. The table is open-addressed on the id with linear probing and
//! backward-shift deletion, so lookups and removals cost a probe sequence
//! rather than a scan, and every probe loop is bounded by the storage length.
//!
//! The table also holds the kernel to the rule the crate documentation states:
//! never more than `entries` submissions outstanding. That bound is what keeps
//! the submission ring from overflowing without the kernel ever reading the
//! driver's `sub_head` — every unconsumed submission is outstanding — and what
//! guarantees the driver room in the completion ring.
//!
//! # Ending, and the data VMO
//!
//! A ring ends in one of three ways: the driver answers STOP with STOPPED, the
//! driver dies (its process ends or its control channel closes), or this side
//! detects corruption and the kernel treats the driver as dead. However it
//! ends, every outstanding request fails with EIO *at once* — [`KernelSide::end`]
//! hands them over — and the kernel does not wait for anything else.
//!
//! What it does wait for is the data VMO. Its pages are pinned for the device,
//! and on an untranslated domain, which is every domain today, a device that
//! was not reset can still write to those frames after they are unpinned. Not
//! even an orderly STOPPED proves the reset: it is the driver's word, and the
//! driver is not trusted. So devmgr resets the device before any pinned frame
//! is freed, and until it confirms, the pages stay held — leaked by design, and
//! the kernel glue logs it. [`KernelSide::data_vmo`] answers
//! [`DataVmo::HeldUntilReset`] from the moment a ring ends until the glue calls
//! [`KernelSide::confirm_reset`], and nothing else makes it
//! [`DataVmo::Releasable`]. If devmgr cannot reset the device, the glue never
//! calls it and the pages are never freed.
