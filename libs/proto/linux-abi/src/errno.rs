//! Error numbers and the negative-return convention.
//!
//! A Linux system call has one return register and no separate error channel.
//! Failure is signalled by returning `-errno`, and the C library turns that
//! back into `-1` plus a thread-local `errno`. The kernel side of the bargain
//! is therefore purely arithmetic, and [`encode`] is the one place this crate
//! performs it.
//!
//! The values are the generic ones from `include/uapi/asm-generic/errno-base.h`
//! and `errno.h`. Both architectures Ferrix targets use them unchanged; only
//! the MIPS and Alpha families renumber, and neither is a target here.

/// A Linux error number, as a positive value.
///
/// Stored positive because that is how the number is written everywhere except
/// in the return register; [`Errno::as_return_value`] performs the single
/// negation on the way out.
