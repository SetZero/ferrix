//! Base address registers: where a function's registers are, and how big.
//!
//! A BAR holds an address and, in its low bits, what kind of address it is —
//! I/O port or memory, 32 or 64 bits wide, prefetchable or not. The *size*
//! is not stored anywhere. It is found by writing all ones and reading back
//! which bits stuck: the bits a device hardwires to zero below its aperture
//! are the ones inside it, so the mask read back is one run of ones, and the
//! run's lowest bit is the size.
//!
//! [`size`] does that, and does the two things a sizing routine forgets.
//!
//! * **Decoding is switched off first.** Between the write of all ones and the
//!   restore, the BAR claims an aperture at the top of the address space. A
//!   function still decoding memory at that moment answers reads and writes
//!   meant for whatever really lives there — on most machines, firmware.
//! * **Both halves of a 64-bit BAR are sized and restored.** Size only the
//!   low half and a 4 GiB aperture reads as a 0-byte one; restore only the low
//!   half and the device is left decoding somewhere above 4 GiB that nothing
//!   assigned it.
//!
//! Neither mistake is visible until two devices share a machine, which on
//! QEMU is never, and on a board is the first time anything is plugged in.
