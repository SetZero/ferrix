//! Owning a handle, and giving it up.
//!
//! A handle a program holds is closed when its owner is dropped, the way a
//! `File` closes its descriptor. Every object type in this crate is an
//! [`OwnedHandle`] underneath, and [`Object`] is what they share: the handle,
//! the way to make calls, and the two waits every object answers.
//!
//! # Why adopting a raw handle is safe here
//!
//! `std`'s `OwnedFd::from_raw_fd` is `unsafe`, because a descriptor number is
//! reused as soon as it is closed: adopting one you do not own can close a file
//! somebody else opens later. A handle is different. `libs/objects` gives a
//! slot a new generation every time it is reused and retires it rather than
//! wrap, so a value once closed never names anything again; adopting a handle
//! you do not own can close a handle somebody else holds — a logic error, the
//! kernel answers the second close with `BAD_HANDLE` — and cannot reach memory
//! at all. Handles are not memory, so [`OwnedHandle::from_raw`] is safe.
