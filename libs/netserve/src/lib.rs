//! A ring-3 network driver's serve loop.
//!
//! Two libraries already know everything about their side. `ferrix-netring`'s
//! [`DriverSide`] takes the kernel's submissions and makes its completions;
//! `ferrix-virtio-net`'s driver turns a frame into descriptors and a used
//! entry into an event. What is left between them is a loop, and the loop is
//! where the two sides' rules meet.
//!
//! That loop is this crate, written against a [`Nic`] trait so it runs and is
//! tested on the host with a fake device on one side and the ring's own kernel
//! end on the other. The process that runs it (`user/net`) adds only the
//! handles.
//!
//! # The two directions are not symmetrical, and that is the whole design
//!
//! **Sending** is a copy and a submission: the kernel put the frame in a ring
//! slot, the loop copies it into the device's transmit region and hands it
//! over, and the slot is completed when the device says the frame went.
//!
//! **Receiving** cannot work that way. A frame arrives when it arrives, into a
//! buffer the *device* chose, and the kernel's ring slot is picked afterwards.
//! So the loop keeps the receive slots the kernel posted in a queue, and a
//! frame that arrives takes the oldest. A frame that arrives with no slot
//! waiting is dropped and counted -- there is nowhere to put it, and holding
//! it would mean holding a device buffer the device needs back.
//!
//! # What is never done
//!
//! * **A submission is never consumed that cannot be answered.**
//!   [`DriverSide::take`] advances the ring's head, so a submission taken is
//!   one the driver owes a completion for. The loop takes only as many as it
//!   has room to complete.
//! * **A device buffer is released as soon as its bytes are copied**, not when
//!   the kernel drains the completion. A receive buffer the driver holds is a
//!   frame the device cannot deliver, and the kernel's drain is not on the
//!   device's critical path.
//! * **Nothing is retried for ever.** A device that reports an error stops the
//!   loop so the process can reset it and leave; a ring that reports
//!   corruption does the same.
