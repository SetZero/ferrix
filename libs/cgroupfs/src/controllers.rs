//! The controllers, `cgroup.controllers`, and writes to
//! `cgroup.subtree_control`.
//!
//! A set of controllers prints as their names in Linux's subsystem order,
//! one space between, and a newline -- a bare newline when there are none
//! (`cgroup_print_ss_mask`). A write to `cgroup.subtree_control` is parsed as
//! `cgroup_subtree_control_write` parses it: surrounding whitespace dropped,
//! then tokens split on single spaces, empty ones skipped, each `+name` or
//! `-name`. A later token for a controller overrides an earlier one, so
//! `+memory -memory` disables it. A name the kernel does not have, or a token
//! without its sign, refuses the whole write, and nothing of it is applied.
