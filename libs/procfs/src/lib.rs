//! The text of `/proc`, as pure functions of what the kernel knows.
//!
//! A `/proc` file is an interface, not a report. `ps`, `free`, a C library's
//! `sysconf`, a debugger and a garbage collector all read these files with
//! `sscanf` and fixed columns written against what Linux prints, and a field
//! one column off or a label one space short is a program that silently reads
//! the wrong number. So the formats are pinned here, byte for byte, against
//! lines taken from a real Linux, where `cargo test` can hold them — rather
//! than in the kernel, where the first test of a format would be a program
//! misreading its own memory map.
//!
//! Nothing here knows where the numbers come from. The kernel gathers them —
//! an address space's regions, the frame allocator's counts, a process's
//! identity — and these functions only arrange them. That is also what keeps
//! the kernel honest about a field it cannot fill: it has to pass a value,
//! and the place it does so is the place a comment says why.
//!
//! # What is here
//!
//! * [`maps`] — `/proc/<pid>/maps`, and the parser the kernel's boot check
//!   reads its own output back with.
//! * [`meminfo`] — `/proc/meminfo`.
//! * [`status`] — `/proc/<pid>/status`, and the CPU mask and list formats.
//! * [`stat`] — `/proc/<pid>/stat`, fifty-two fields on one line.
//! * [`kstat`] — `/proc/stat`, each processor's time and the kernel's
//!   counters, and the parser the kernel's boot check reads it back with.
//! * [`mounts`] — `/proc/mounts`, with the octal escapes a mount point with a
//!   space in it needs.
//! * [`filesystems`] — `/proc/filesystems`, the types `mount -t` takes.
//! * [`net`] — `/proc/net`: `dev`, `route`, `tcp`, `udp` and `arp`, which
//!   `route`, `netstat` and `ifconfig` read with `sscanf` and fixed columns.
//! * [`partitions`] — `/proc/partitions`.
//! * [`sysctl`] — the values under `/proc/sys`, and what a write to a string
//!   one stores.
