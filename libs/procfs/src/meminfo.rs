//! Linux's `show_val_kb` writes a label already padded to sixteen bytes, colon
//! included, and the value right-aligned in eight; a value wider than eight
//! pushes the unit along rather than being cut, which the second line shows.
//! `free` and a C library's `sysconf(_SC_AVPHYS_PAGES)` read these by label, so
//! a line that is absent is survivable and a line that lies is not — which is
//! why [`Meminfo`] has only the lines a kernel can fill truthfully, in the
//! order Linux prints them.
