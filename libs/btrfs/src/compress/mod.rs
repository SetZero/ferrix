//! Decompression of extent data: zlib, LZO and zstd, as btrfs frames them.
//!
//! An `EXTENT_DATA` item names its algorithm in `compression`, and the bytes it
//! points at — inline in the item or in an extent elsewhere — are one
//! compressed stream that expands to at most `ram_bytes`. btrfs caps a
//! compressed extent at 128 KiB of uncompressed data, so the caller always
//! knows an upper bound on the output before it starts, and every decoder here
//! writes into a caller-supplied buffer rather than allocating.
//!
//! # The same rules as the rest of the crate
//!
//! The input is whatever is on the disk. Each decoder is total — any input at
//! all produces a length or a [`BtrfsError`], never a panic, an out-of-bounds
//! write or a loop that does not terminate — and is written without `unsafe`.
//! Back-references are resolved against the output buffer itself, which is
//! also the window: an extent is decompressed whole, so every distance a
//! well-formed stream can name lies inside what has already been written, and
//! one that does not is corrupt.
//!
//! # A short result is not an error
//!
//! A decoder returns how many bytes it produced. That can be fewer than
//! `output.len()`: Linux zero-fills the rest of the range, and so must the
//! caller. Producing *more* than fits is corruption, reported as
//! [`BtrfsError::BadCompressedData`].
