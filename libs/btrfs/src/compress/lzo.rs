//! LZO, as btrfs frames it: one independent LZO1X stream per sector.
//!
//! LZO has no container format of its own, so btrfs wraps one. The layout is
//! the same for an inline extent and a regular one: a little-endian `u32`
//! holding the length of the whole compressed extent *including those four
//! bytes*, then one or more segments. A segment is a `u32` length and that
//! many bytes of LZO1X, and each is the compression of at most one sector of
//! the file. The stream itself is decoded by [`lzo1x`]; this module is the
//! framing around it.
//!
//! ```text
//! 0       4       8                   +len0          sector boundary
//! +-------+-------+-------------------+-------+------------- ~ ---+----+
//! | total | len0  | LZO1X of sector 0 | len1  | LZO1X of sector 1 | 00 |
//! +-------+-------+-------------------+-------+------------- ~ ---+----+
//!                                                 next header here ^
//! ```
//!
//! # Headers are aligned; segments are not
//!
//! Segments are packed end to end with no padding, whatever their length,
//! with one exception, and it is the reason this decoder needs `sectorsize`.
//! A segment *header* never straddles a sector boundary. When fewer than four
//! bytes are left before the next boundary (counting from the start of the
//! extent, not of the disk), the writer pads them with zeroes and starts the
//! header on the boundary. Linux reads each header through a mapping of one
//! sector-sized page, which is where the rule comes from. A reader that does
//! not apply it reads its next length out of the padding, and everything after
//! that is garbage that may still happen to parse.
//!
//! # Segments do not share a window
//!
//! Linux decompresses every segment into a scratch buffer of its own, so a
//! back-reference in one segment can never name a byte that an earlier segment
//! produced. No writer emits one, and Linux refuses one. That is narrower than
//! [`super`]'s rule that the whole output is the window, and it is enforced
//! structurally: the LZO1X decoder is handed only this segment's share of the
//! output, a subslice that starts where the segment's first byte goes and is
//! at most one sector long. A distance that reaches further back is then out
//! of bounds for the slice it has, rather than caught by a check that someone
//! has to remember. Accepting it would decode bytes Linux calls corruption,
//! and one file would read differently on the two kernels.
//!
//! # What is checked, and where Linux's checks come from
//!
//! - The total length has to cover its own header, fit the input and fit the
//!   128 KiB `BTRFS_MAX_COMPRESSED`, and it must not leave a whole sector of the
//!   input unused. Linux makes the last two checks in `lzo_decompress_bio`,
//!   because an extent whose header undercounts its own sectors is corrupt, not
//!   merely generous.
//! - A segment length may not exceed `lzo1x_worst_compress(sectorsize)`, the
//!   size of Linux's scratch buffer and the most one sector can grow to.
//! - A segment must end within the total length. Linux bounds it only by the
//!   input, which also holds the padding at the end of the last sector. The
//!   writer never puts a segment there, so reading past the total means
//!   reading bytes the header says are not part of the extent.
//! - A segment must decode to at most one sector, and into what is left of the
//!   output. Its stream must end in the end-of-stream marker, exactly at the
//!   segment's last byte. Linux's `lzo1x_decompress_safe` returns an error for
//!   input left over after the marker, and btrfs treats that error as EIO.
//!
//! Decoding stops when the total length is consumed or the output is full.
//! Output that is full at a segment boundary is the caller's range satisfied,
//! and Linux stops there too. A segment that overflows what is left is
//! corruption.
