//! From the display core's requests to device commands, and back.
//!
//! Each request the core sends becomes a short sequence of steps, run one at
//! a time:
//!
//! | Request | Steps | Reply |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | ATTACH | pin the range, `RESOURCE_CREATE_2D`, `RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING` | ATTACHED |
//! | SCANOUT | `SET_SCANOUT` | none |
//! | FLUSH | `TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D`, `RESOURCE_FLUSH` | FLIPPED |
//! | CURSOR | `TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D`, then `UPDATE_CURSOR` on the cursor queue | FLIPPED |
//! | DETACH | `RESOURCE_DETACH_BACKING`, `RESOURCE_UNREF`, unpin | DETACHED |
//!
//! MOVE is not a request here: it waits for nothing on the control queue,
//! so the glue hands it to the driver's cursor queue the moment it is read,
//! and a CURSOR's place is taken the same way. What the pipeline keeps in
//! order is the image, which must be on the device before the cursor queue
//! is told to show it.
//!
//! A step that fails is undone as far as it safely can be: a resource created
//! and then refused its backing is unreferenced and its range unpinned. One
//! rule is never bent: pages the device may still hold as backing are not
//! unpinned. If the device refuses `RESOURCE_DETACH_BACKING`, the range stays
//! pinned for good and DETACHED says the device refused, which tells the core
//! never to hand the range out again.
//!
//! The pipeline does nothing itself. [`Pipeline::next`] says what the glue is
//! to do — pin, submit a command, unpin, reply, or wait — and the glue reports
//! back with [`Pipeline::pinned`] and [`Pipeline::done`].
