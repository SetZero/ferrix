//! Netlink messages: walking a buffer of them and their attributes, and
//! building replies into a buffer the caller owns.
//!
//! `libs/linux-abi` names netlink's numbers and lays out its fixed headers,
//! and says in as many words that walking a buffer of messages is left to this
//! crate. This is that crate: the byte-level half of `AF_NETLINK`, with no
//! socket, no interface table and no state of any kind.
//!
//! # A walk is a stranger's arithmetic, so it is checked and it ends
//!
//! A netlink buffer is a chain of length-prefixed messages, each holding a
//! chain of length-prefixed attributes, and every one of those lengths was
//! written by whoever called `sendmsg`. Three of them end a kernel that trusts
//! them: a length of zero, which walks the same message for ever; a length
//! below the header it introduces, which makes the payload start after it
//! ends; and a length past the end of the buffer, which reads somebody else's
//! memory. [`Messages`] and [`Attributes`] answer each of the three with
//! [`Error::Truncated`] and stop, and every step forward is at least a
//! header's worth, so a walk over any bytes at all ends after at most one step
//! per four bytes of input. The `netlink_walk` fuzz target holds them to it.
//!
//! # Nothing is allocated and nothing is copied
//!
//! A walk borrows its payloads from the buffer it was given, and the builder
//! writes into a buffer the caller already owns and answers how many bytes it
//! took. That is what lets the kernel encode a reply inside the lock that
//! holds the net core, where an allocation would be a bug: `libs/net` and its
//! lock are `kernel/src/net`'s, and nothing that could sleep may happen while
//! it is held.
//!
//! ```
