//! The restart policy (`docs/INIT.md` §5.4): whether an end restarts a
//! service or a driver, after how long, and when to give up.
//!
//! Its own crate, and one that allocates nothing, because `devmgr` -- a
//! `no_std` native program with no allocator -- shares it with the service
//! manager (`libs/init/svc`, which re-exports every name here from where it
//! always was). It also parses nothing: the text of `Restart=` or a signal's
//! name is the service manager's to read.
//!
//! * [`wanted`]: systemd's table of which ends each `Restart=` restarts.
//! * [`Backoff`]: `RestartSec=`, doubled on each restart in a row, up to 32
//!   times it.
//! * [`Budget`]: the start limit, `StartLimitBurst=` starts within
//!   `StartLimitIntervalSec=`. Every start is counted, asked for or not, as
//!   systemd counts it. Given no clock, it is a plain count of starts.
//!
//! [`Policy`] puts them together: restart now, restart at `t`, or give up.
//! [`Instant`], [`Signal`], [`Exit`] and [`Restart`] are the words it is
//! decided in.
