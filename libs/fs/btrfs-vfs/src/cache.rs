//! A bounded cache of what a mount reads as metadata: the superblock and tree
//! nodes.
//!
//! Every lookup descends a tree from its root, so the same few nodes are read on
//! every call. On a read-only volume the bytes at a physical address never
//! change, so a node read once can be handed out again without asking the
//! device. Only reads `ferrix-btrfs` marks [`ReadKind::Metadata`] are kept: file
//! data belongs in the page cache, and the two never hold the same bytes.
//!
//! A hit returns exactly the bytes the device would, so nothing downstream
//! trusts it more: `ferrix-btrfs` still checks every node's level, generation,
//! fsid and checksum against what its parent promised.
//!
//! Entries are shared `Arc<[u8]>`s. A hit takes a reference under the lock and
//! copies with the lock released; a miss reads the device with no lock held and
//! keeps the bytes only if no racing reader already did. Eviction is CLOCK over
//! a fixed number of entries. Stage 12, which writes, must invalidate by
//! physical range before a cache like this sits under a writable volume.
