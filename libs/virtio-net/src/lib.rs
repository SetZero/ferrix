//! A virtio-net driver, as logic over a transport and DMA memory it is handed.
//!
//! This is `ferrix-virtio-blk` for the network device, over the same four
//! traits and with the same two invariants, so what follows says only what is
//! different. A driver process holds an `IoMapping` of the device's register
//! blocks, an `Interrupt` and pinned DMA memory whose device addresses came
//! from an IOMMU domain, none of which can be had in a unit test; so the
//! driver is written against [`Transport`], [`DevicePages`], [`RequestArea`]
//! and [`ferrix_virtio::QueueMemory`], and this crate is the order of the
//! status protocol, which features to take, how a frame becomes a chain and a
//! completion becomes an event, and what to do when the device lies.
//!
//! # Two queues, and what each is for
//!
//! virtio 1.2 §5.1.2 gives the device a receive queue (0) and a transmit queue
//! (1), and a control queue (2) this driver does not negotiate. The two are
//! not symmetrical and the asymmetry is the shape of the whole crate:
//!
//! * **Receive** buffers are the *driver's*. It carves
//!   [`Info::receive_buffers`] of them out of the receive data region, posts
//!   every one at bring-up, and posts them again as they come back, because a
//!   receive queue with no buffers in it drops every frame that arrives and
//!   says nothing. A frame that arrives is answered as [`Event::Received`] —
//!   an offset and a length in that region — and the buffer stays out of the
//!   ring until the caller has read it and called [`Driver::release`].
//! * **Transmit** buffers are the *caller's*. It writes a frame into the
//!   transmit data region, names it with an id, and gets that id back in
//!   [`Event::Sent`] when the device is done reading, which is the only
//!   moment the bytes may be overwritten.
//!
//! Each frame is one chain: a header descriptor pointing into the request
//! area, then one descriptor per run of device-contiguous pages the frame
//! covers. Because [`ferrix_virtio::net::FEATURE_MRG_RXBUF`] is declined, a
//! received frame is one buffer and never a reassembly; see that module for
//! the argument.
//!
//! # DMA memory is freed only after a reset
//!
//! As in `ferrix-virtio-blk`: a device holds addresses into the rings, the
//! headers and the frame regions for as long as it is not reset, so the driver
//! keeps them in [`ManuallyDrop`], dropping a [`Driver`] leaks rather than
//! frees, and only [`Driver::shutdown`] gives them back — as
//! [`Teardown::Released`] if the reset finished and [`Teardown::Wedged`] if it
//! did not.
//!
//! # Every id is answered exactly once
//!
//! Every id [`Driver::submit`] accepted is answered exactly once: by an
//! [`Event::Sent`] from [`Driver::on_interrupt`], or — once the device has
//! broken the protocol and the driver has stopped trusting it — by
//! [`Released::abandoned`] after the reset. An id `submit` refused for a
//! reason of the caller's is not tracked at all.
//!
//! # Trust
//!
//! Everything the device says is checked before it is acted on: the used rings
//! by [`SplitQueue`], a completion's length and a received header by
//! [`net::parse_receipt`] and [`net::parse_sent`], the configuration by
//! [`net::Config::read`] and [`net::Limits::new`], read again if
//! `config_generation` moves. A device that fails a check is marked failed, is
//! sent nothing more, and waits for [`Driver::shutdown`].
