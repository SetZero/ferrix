"""Hold the safety manual to its evidence.

`docs/certification/SAFETY-MANUAL.md` is an out-of-context safety argument: an
integrator reads it, designs against its assumed safety requirements, and
discharges its assumptions of use. That makes a stale claim in it worse than no
manual at all, because a manual is believed and a missing one is not.

So every claim names its evidence in `scripts/data/safety-requirements.json`, and
this asserts three things about the pair.

  1. **The manual and the register agree on which ids exist.** An `ASR-9` added
     to one and not the other fails, in either direction. A requirement that
     exists only in prose has no evidence; one that exists only in the register
     is claiming nothing.

  2. **Every named piece of evidence exists.** A file path must resolve, and a
     `path::symbol` reference must actually name something in that file. This
     is the check that earns its place: the manual cites `zero_frame`,
     `check_stacks`, `enable_user_access_protection` and a dozen others, and a
     rename that left the manual behind would leave an argument pointing at
     nothing.

  3. **Every requirement has evidence at all.** An ASR with an empty
     `demonstrated_by` is an assertion, and the manual's whole claim is that it
     does not make those.

The register also holds the unsafe obligations (finding F-26): the closed set
of reasons unsafe exists in the certified item, which every unsafe site there
names by id and `check-unsafe-audit.py` resolves. The same three checks hold
them: the manual's table of them (`| `(ID)` |` rows) and the register agree,
each one's `serves` names a requirement, failure mode or assumption of use the
register defines, and each one's `argued_by` resolves.

What it deliberately does not check: whether the evidence actually *supports*
the claim. No script can. It checks that the citation resolves, which is the
part that rots silently.
