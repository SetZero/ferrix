"""Decision (branch) coverage of the kernel's object code, from the drcov
traces `coverage-report.py` already reads.

DO-178C table A-7 objective 6 (DAL B and above) asks that every decision in
the software has taken every outcome. `coverage-report.py` answers objective 5,
statement coverage, from QEMU's `drcov` plugin: the basic blocks a boot
executed, read against the DWARF line table. The same traces answer a
narrower question about decisions, without instrumenting anything:

    For each conditional branch instruction in the kernel image, did control
    leave it both ways?

QEMU ends a translation block at every conditional branch, and control that
leaves one enters the next block *at its first instruction*: the branch's
target if it was taken, the instruction after it if it was not. The plugin
records the address every executed block starts at. So a branch took its
"taken" outcome if some block starts at its target, and its "not taken"
outcome if some block starts at its fall-through.

    python3 tools/common/gen/decision-coverage.py --arch x86_64 \\
        --elf build/coverage/x86_64/ferrix-kernel-<hash>.elf \\
        --drcov build/coverage/x86_64/*.drcov

`cargo xtask coverage` runs it after the statement report, over the same
traces and the same reference ELF.

What is counted
---------------

A *branch* is a direct conditional branch in the image's code:

  x86-64    every `jcc`, and `jrcxz`/`loop` should the compiler emit them
  AArch64   `b.<cond>`, `cbz`/`cbnz`, `tbz`/`tbnz`
  ARMv7-A   `b<cond>`, and `cbz`/`cbnz` should Thumb code appear

A conditional *call* (`bl<cond>`) or a conditional *indirect* branch
(`bx<cond> lr`, `pop<cond> {..., pc}`) has an outcome the block starts cannot
tell apart -- a call returns to its fall-through either way, and an indirect
target is not in the instruction -- so each is counted and listed apart as
not measured, never as covered.

Each branch is attributed to the file and line the line table gives its
address -- the innermost source, so a branch of an inlined kernel function is
that function's, not its caller's -- and to a ring by the boundary gate's
classifier, as a statement is. A branch in a file outside `src/kernel/src`
(`core`, `alloc`, the `src/lib/` crates) is outside the item, as its statements
are; the report says how many there were.

The unit is the *object-code* branch. A source decision the compiler copied --
inlined into six callers, or monomorphised twice -- is six or two branches,
and each has to take both ways. A source decision the compiler turned into a
`cmov`, `csel` or a predicated ARM instruction is no branch at all, and is not
counted. This is branch coverage of object code, not source decision coverage
and not MC/DC; VERIFICATION.md section 3.6 argues what that is worth.

Each branch is sorted into one of five:

  both          both successors began a block
  taken         only the target did
  not-taken     only the fall-through did
  no-outcome    a block containing the branch ran, and neither successor began
                one: the boot ended there, a fault left the block before the
                branch, or the method has missed something. Expected to be
                close to zero, and printed, because it is the method's own
                check
  unreached     no executed block contains the branch

Guards
------

A branch one of whose successors runs, with no other decision or call first,
into a function that panics -- `core::panicking`, `unwrap_failed`, a slice
index failure, `handle_alloc_error`, the kernel's `fatal!` -- is a *guard*:
an overflow or bounds check, an `unwrap`, a `debug_assert!`, a precondition
`core` checks in a debug build, a `fatal!`. A passing run never takes its
panicking way, so no passing suite can take it both ways, and the report
gives the item's figure with guards and without them. The guards are the
object-code counterpart of the statement residual's "reached only when
something has already failed".

Two figures and a view
----------------------

  both ways   a block began at each successor. An upper bound: a block can
              begin at a successor for a reason other than this branch --
              another conditional branch's fall-through, a jump, a call's
              return or a jump table can enter the same address.
  sure        each of those blocks is this branch's doing: every *other*
              instruction with a known edge into that successor -- a branch
              or jump to it, a conditional branch it follows, a call it
              returns from -- lies in no executed block. A lower bound, short
              only of an indirect jump, or an interrupt or exception return,
              landing there.

  The truth lies between the two. drcov records blocks, not the edges between
  them, so nothing in its traces can narrow it further; QEMU's `cflow` plugin
  records edges and would.

  by source   a decision is (file, line, its order among the branches at that
              line in one compiled copy), guards left out, and it is covered
              when any copy of it took both ways -- nearer the source-level
              decision DO-178C means, and optimistic where two copies order
              one line's branches differently.

Several builds
--------------

Gates build different kernels (`coverage-report.py` says why). A branch is
named across builds by the function it is in, the file and line it is
attributed to, and its order among that function's branches at that line;
each trace is read against its own ELF and slide, and the outcomes are unioned
by name onto the branches of `--elf`, which is the denominator. A branch of
another build with no namesake in `--elf` is counted and reported, not added.
