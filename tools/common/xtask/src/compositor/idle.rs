//! The two hypridle boots: `idle`, with a configuration of its own whose
//! timeouts are seconds, and `idle-user`, with the user's own
//! `~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf` read off this machine at build time and
//! carried unchanged.
//!
//! Both boot the compositor with two windows and `/bin/hypridle` started
//! by `exec-once`, and both are judged by what the screen shows and what
//! hypridle said: the screen goes black when a listener's `on-timeout` runs
//! `hyprctl dispatch dpms off`, and comes back when a key -- QEMU's virtio
//! keyboard, the same path a person's typing takes -- ends the idle and the
//! listener's `on-resume` runs `hyprctl dispatch dpms on`.
//!
//! The first also presses a key bound to `loginctl lock-session`, which is
//! how the user's file locks, and requires the whole chain Ferrix has for
//! it: `loginctl` reaching hypridle over its socket, `lock_cmd` starting
//! `/bin/lock`, the compositor telling hypridle through
//! `hyprland-lock-notify-v1` that the session locked and unlocked, and
//! `on_lock_cmd` and `on_unlock_cmd` running.
//!
//! The second cannot wait the ten and fifteen minutes the user's file asks
//! for, so a key bound to `hyprctl dispatch forceidle` says the seat has
//! been idle one second longer than its longest timeout: every listener
//! fires as it would have, and what each one did is printed as the record
//! of the user's file on Ferrix.
