//! Stage 12's exit: boot, write a tree on a blank btrfs volume, and let host
//! `btrfs check` judge what was written.
//!
//! The guest's half is `kernel/src/fs/btrfs_write_check.rs`, which builds a
//! tree on the third disk, unmounts, mounts again and reads it all back; it
//! proves the bytes survive a round trip through Ferrix. It cannot prove the
//! trees are the ones btrfs would have written — a writer can be
//! self-consistent and still wrong about the format. That is what this
//! command adds: after the boot, `btrfs check --check-data-csum` from
//! btrfs-progs reads the same image, checks every tree against every other
//! and every data checksum against the data, and any complaint fails the
//! command.
//!
//! btrfs-progs must be on the host. Without it the command fails rather than
//! passing quietly: a gate that skips is not a gate. On Windows it is looked
//! for in WSL as well, since that is where the rest of the Linux tooling
//! lives.
