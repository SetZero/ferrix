//! oh-my-zsh, the configuration every shell in the image starts with.
//!
//! zinc's acceptance criterion is that oh-my-zsh runs in it, and a criterion
//! nothing boots with is one nobody meets twice. The image therefore carries a
//! checkout of oh-my-zsh at [`DIRECTORY`] and an `/etc/zshrc` that sources it,
//! so the shell the kernel starts comes up with the theme, the aliases and the
//! completion oh-my-zsh gives it, rather than as a bare shell someone must
//! first install something into over a network the guest may not have.
//!
//! The checkout is a download rather than something in this repository, for
//! the reason busybox and the ports are: it is another project's tree, under
//! another project's licence, changing on their schedule and not on ours. It
//! is installed under `~/.local/share/ferrix/oh-my-zsh` (or `$FERRIX_OMZ`) by
//! `cargo xtask omz --from <DIRECTORY-OR-URL>`, the one thing here that
//! reaches the network, and then only because it was asked for by name. An
//! image built on a machine without it says so and boots without it.
