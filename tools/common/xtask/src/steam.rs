//! `test-steam-bootstrap`: the Steam client's bootstrapper on Ferrix, as far
//! as it goes before it needs a display (`docs/I386.md`, I5b).
//!
//! Valve's `steam.sh` is what `/usr/bin/steam` runs: a bash script that sets
//! up the Steam Runtime ("scout") beside it and starts the 32-bit
//! `ubuntu12_32/steam`. That program downloads the client proper from Valve,
//! installs it and exits 42, and `steam.sh` starts again: unpacks the new
//! runtime with GNU `tar`, lets scout's 64-bit helpers check the machine,
//! starts the client again, which verifies what it installed, loads
//! `steamui.so`, and asks for an X display. Headless, there is none, and the
//! client says "Unable to open X11 display" and exits: that line is what
//! this gate waits for, and it is where the X server (`docs/YSERVER.md`)
//! takes over.
//!
//! # The volume
//!
//! `tools/common/fetch/fetch-steam.sh` makes it: the bootstrap under `steam/`, an
//! empty home, and from Debian 13 the i386 and amd64 C libraries, the four
//! GL libraries `steamui.so` needs that scout does not carry, and the shell
//! tools `steam.sh` runs (`bash`, GNU `tar` and `xz`, `grep`, `sed`, `mawk`,
//! `find`, `which`, `ldd`). It is attached under QEMU's `snapshot=on`, as
//! steamcmd's is, so every run starts from the bootstrap and downloads the
//! client again.
//!
//! # `uname`
//!
//! `steam.sh` stops with "Unsupported Operating System" unless `uname` says
//! `Linux`, and Ferrix's says `Ferrix` (the customer's choice, 2026-09-13).
//! The image puts [`UNAME`] first in `PATH`, which says `Linux` to the two
//! questions the scripts ask by name and passes every other one to busybox.
//!
//! # What stops it today, and the two things the gate sets aside
//!
//! * Scout's `steam-runtime-check-requirements` refuses a kernel without
//!   user namespaces ("Steam now requires user namespaces to be enabled",
//!   exit 71), which `steam.sh` treats as fatal, and Ferrix has none. The
//!   script runs the check once and prints its verdict, then makes it not
//!   executable, which `steam.sh` answers with "continuing anyway" -- and
//!   again whenever it is executable once more, since the client's update
//!   unpacks a new runtime over the old one and `steam.sh` checks again.
//! * System V semaphores are `ENOSYS`, and the client then prints "Thread
//!   synchronization object is unuseable" and waits forever, before it has
//!   downloaded anything. The script stops there, and the gate fails saying
//!   so. Whether Ferrix gets them is the customer's decision
//!   (`docs/BACKLOG.md`, *Waiting on the customer*). To see past it,
//!   `FERRIX_STEAM_PRELOAD` may name an i386 shared object the image carries
//!   at [`PRELOAD_PATH`] and preloads into every program, and the verdict
//!   then names it: a diagnostic stand-in, not a pass.
//!
//! # Under KVM, and on the internet
//!
//! As `test-steamcmd`: the client reads `cpu MHz`, which Ferrix prints only
//! when its clock is the TSC, and it downloads from Valve, so the gate is run
//! on demand and not in the image row.
