//! `test-claude-code`: Anthropic's Claude Code on Ferrix, running a command
//! of its own in bash.
//!
//! The program is Claude Code's native linux-x64 release, not one built
//! here: a 234 MB glibc program -- a JavaScript runtime with Claude Code
//! bundled into it -- run by Debian's `ld-linux` on Debian's glibc, beside
//! Debian's bash and ripgrep, all of it on a btrfs volume
//! `tools/common/fetch/fetch-claude-code.sh` makes from pinned downloads.
//! `docs/CLAUDE-CODE.md` says what it needs and what is left.
//!
//! Two steps, the second a proof of much more than the first: `--version`,
//! which says the program loaded, its libraries resolved and its runtime
//! started; and one turn of `claude -p`, against a Messages API this process
//! serves ([`Api`]), in which the model asks for a Bash command, Claude Code
//! runs it in bash on Ferrix, and sends back what it printed. The reply the
//! guest prints is only written once that output has arrived, so the line
//! says the whole loop ran: HTTP over the network, the streaming reply
//! parsed, a tool call dispatched, a child process in a shell, and its
//! output read back.
//!
//! # No model, and no key
//!
//! `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points Claude Code at [`Api`], on the host's loopback
//! through the gateway's `10.0.2.2`, as `test-net`'s servers are. It answers
//! the requests Claude Code makes with fixed replies, so the gate costs
//! nothing, needs no account, and says the same thing on a machine with no
//! internet. Its key is a made-up one [`Api`] requires. Claude Code's
//! nonessential traffic -- telemetry, error reports, the update check -- is
//! turned off by its own variable, so nothing else leaves the guest.
//!
//! # Where Claude Code lives
//!
//! As Chrome's does: the volume carries no `ferrix-root` label, so the kernel
//! mounts it at `/data`, under QEMU's `snapshot=on`, and the initramfs links
//! the paths glibc names into it ([`LINKS`]). busybox is on the image for
//! `udhcpc`; zinc runs the script; bash is the volume's, and `SHELL` names it,
//! since Claude Code's Bash tool will run commands in bash or zsh and in
//! nothing else.
//!
//! Claude Code is started as `claude`, [`WRAPPER`] at `/bin/claude`, which is
//! what the `--everything` desktop's terminals have too ([`desktop_files`]):
//! `everything.rs` merges this volume's tree into that desktop's. With
//! `--everything` the gate boots that merged volume in place of this one, so
//! what it passes is what the desktop runs.
