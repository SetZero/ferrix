//! `test-steamcmd`: Valve's steamcmd on Ferrix, logging in to Steam
//! anonymously (`docs/I386.md`, I5a).
//!
//! steamcmd is the Steam client's core without its display: a 32-bit glibc
//! program, run here by Debian's i386 `ld-linux.so.2` in compatibility mode on
//! the x86-64 kernel. It updates itself from Valve's servers on its first run,
//! exits 42 to be started again as its own `steamcmd.sh` would, and then
//! connects to Steam, fetches the client configuration and its user's
//! information, and quits. Each of those steps prints a line, and the last
//! one, "Waiting for user info...OK", says the login was whole.
//!
//! # The volume, and the network
//!
//! `tools/common/fetch/fetch-steamcmd.sh` makes the volume: Debian's `libc6:i386`
//! and steamcmd, unpacked and not yet updated. It carries no `ferrix-root`
//! label, so the kernel mounts it at `/data`, attached under QEMU's
//! `snapshot=on`, so the update steamcmd writes beside itself is thrown away
//! with the run and every run starts from the same files. glibc names its
//! paths absolutely, so the initramfs links them into `/data` ([`LINKS`]).
//!
//! # Under KVM
//!
//! Steam's runtime reads the processor's clock rate from cpufreq or from
//! `/proc/cpuinfo`'s `cpu MHz`, and stops without it ("Unable to determine
//! CPU Frequency"). Ferrix prints `cpu MHz` when its counter is the TSC, whose
//! rate it measured against the HPET; under TCG the counter is the HPET
//! itself, whose rate says nothing about the processor's, and the line is not
//! printed rather than wrong. So the gate boots under KVM unless `--accel`
//! names another accelerator, and under TCG it fails at that line.
//!
//! # The internet
//!
//! This is the one gate that needs the internet: the boot runs with `--net`,
//! through xtask's gateway, and steamcmd talks to Valve. A failure to reach
//! Valve is a failure here, which is why the gate is run on demand, as
//! `test-chrome` is, and not in the image row.
