//! "An interactive shell over the serial console that a person can use."
//! Every other gate here gives the guest a script and reads what it printed;
//! this one types, one keystroke at a time, into the same serial port a
//! person would, and judges what comes back. That is the only way to test
//! the parts of a session that exist because somebody is at the terminal:
//! the line discipline's signal characters, the foreground process group,
//! and a shell that has to hand the terminal over and take it back.
//!
//! # What is typed, and what each keystroke proves
//!
//! | typed | what it shows |
//! |---|---|
//! | `echo` | the shell reads the console at all: `sh -i`, a prompt, a line |
//! | `sleep 30 &` | a background job is started and announced |
//! | `jobs` | the job table, and that the shell kept it |
//! | `sleep 30 \| cat &`, `kill %1` | one signal reaches a whole pipeline: the job is one process group |
//! | Ctrl-Z | the line discipline raises `SIGTSTP` for the foreground group, and the shell sees the stop through `wait4`'s `WUNTRACED` |
//! | `bg`, `fg` | `SIGCONT` and `tcsetpgrp`, in both directions |
//! | Ctrl-C | `SIGINT` reaches the job and not the shell |
//! | `exit` | the session ends, and init gives the console a new one: its getty respawned |
//!
//! # Why x86-64 only
//!
//! `sleep` is uutils', and uutils is built against ferrousli for x86-64
//! alone (`docs/UUTILS.md` D3). On AArch64 and ARMv7-A the image carries
//! zinc and nothing else, so there is no program to suspend. That is the
//! same backlog row as the rest of the userland's architectures, not a
//! limit of this gate.
