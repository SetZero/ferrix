//! What QEMU writes to its standard error that is not about this guest.
//!
//! A boot's serial output is QEMU's *stdout*; its stderr is QEMU's own
//! remarks, and those are worth reading — an argument it refuses, a device it
//! has not got, the reason a run ended before the guest said anything. So
//! stderr is passed through rather than thrown away, and only one message is
//! taken out of it.
//!
//! # The one message, and why it is not ours to fix
//!
//! `run-compositor --gl` on a Wayland host fills the terminal with
//!
//! ```text
//! (qemu:65917): Gdk-WARNING **: 00:53:50.302: eglMakeCurrent failed
//! ```
//!
//! four times for every frame the guest draws, which at sixty frames a second
//! is a serial log nobody can read.
//!
//! The warning is GDK's, from `gdk_wayland_display_make_gl_context_current`
//! in `gdk/wayland/gdkglcontext-wayland.c`, and the EGL error behind it is
//! `EGL_BAD_ACCESS`: *the context is already current to some other thread*.
//! The other thread is QEMU's vCPU thread. When the guest resets the
//! virtio-gpu — a one-byte write to the device-status register, which every
//! virtio driver does as it starts and as it stops — `virtio_gpu_gl_reset` in
//! `hw/display/virtio-gpu-gl.c` calls `virtio_gpu_virgl_reset_scanout`
//! directly, under a comment saying that GL functions must be called on the
//! main thread. That reaches `gtk_gl_area_make_current` from the vCPU thread
//! and binds the GL area's EGL context there; afterwards GTK's own render
//! callback can never bind it again, and warns once per attempt until the
//! context comes back.
//!
//! It is QEMU's bug, not the guest's — it is reached before the compositor
//! starts, while the loader is still drawing — and it is unfixed upstream as
//! of v10.1. Nothing Ferrix can do from inside the guest avoids it, short of
//! never resetting the card. So the line is hidden here and counted, and
//! [`report`] says how many went.
//!
//! # Why the blank lines go too
//!
//! glib writes a blank line before every message, so dropping the warning on
//! its own would leave the terminal just as long and rather more puzzling. A
//! blank line is therefore held back until the line after it is known: it is
//! printed if that line is printed, and dropped with it if not.
//!
//! # And a run's DMA faults, when it is judged
//!
//! A run this tool judges also has QEMU trace every VT-d fault, and the sieve
//! takes those lines, and QEMU's own remarks about the faults, out of stderr
//! and hands them to [`crate::dma_faults`], which holds them to what the
//! kernel said it provoked. `crate::dma_faults` says why they cannot simply be
//! shown.
