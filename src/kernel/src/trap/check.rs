//! What the trap path does after an `execve`, compared: an [`Outcome::Enter`]
//! is equal only to one with the same entry, stack and mode.
//!
//! Verification, not the trap path: a file of its own so that the manifest
//! counts it as the test it is (`scripts/data/certification-item.json`,
//! `test_file_patterns`). Every architecture's trap check runs it; x86-64's
//! adds the one mode only it has, `Abi::Compat`.
