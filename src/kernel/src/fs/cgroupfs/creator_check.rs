//! A native process runs as the process that made it (`docs/AUTH.md` §7,
//! P0).
//!
//! The escalation it closes, made as a delegated service would make it: root
//! makes `/check-p` and `chown`s it and its `cgroup.procs` to uid 1000, as
//! init does for a `Delegate=yes` unit. A process running as uid 1000 in
//! every id opens the directory, is given `MANAGE` on its job by
//! `job_for_cgroup`, writes an image into a VMO and makes a process from it
//! with `process_create` in that job. The child's ids must be its creator's,
//! all of them, before it starts. Started, it asks `getuid`
//! ([`arch::USER_GETUID_PROGRAM`]) and exits with the answer, which must be
//! 1000's low byte, 232: a child made as root exits 0. The cgroup must then
//! empty, and is removed.
