//! sysfs's boot check (`docs/SYSFS.md` §7): a sysfs mounted under `/tmp`,
//! walked whole through the VFS as `find /sys` would walk it, and what it says
//! held against what its owners know.
//!
//! The walk is what keeps the tree honest with itself: every name a listing
//! gives must look up, as the kind the listing said and with the number it
//! said; every file must open and read to its end; every link must lead,
//! relative to where it is, to a directory in the same mount. Listings are
//! read three names at a time, so every one also resumes from its hash
//! cursor, as `ls` on a big directory does.
//!
//! It runs last among the boot checks, after `devmgr` has started its
//! drivers, so the facts are a running machine's and each is its owner's:
//! enumeration's devices and identifiers, the processors firmware described,
//! the disks the `blk` drivers published and the node each is in, the net
//! core's interfaces, devfs's memory devices, and which driver `devmgr` says
//! drives which device. Writing `bind` and `unbind`, which stops and starts a
//! driver, is `cargo xtask test-sysfs`'s, from a shell.
