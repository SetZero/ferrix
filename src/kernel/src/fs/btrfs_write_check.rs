//! Stage 12's exit, the guest's half: a blank btrfs volume `mkfs.btrfs` made,
//! written through the kernel's own mount path, and read back after a remount.
//!
//! `xtask` attaches a fresh copy of the `blank` fixture as the third
//! virtio-blk disk, so by the time this runs it is `vdc` in the registry. The
//! check mounts it *writable* — `mount -t btrfs /dev/vdc /mnt-rw`, with no
//! `MS_RDONLY` — and builds a tree through the VFS: nested directories, files
//! at every size that matters (empty, inline, a sector, many extents, and one
//! larger than the data chunk `mkfs.btrfs` made, so the writer must allocate
//! a chunk), a file with a hole, a symlink, a hard link, an overwrite in the
//! middle of a file, a truncation, a rename and an unlink.
//!
//! Then it syncs, **unmounts, and mounts again**, and only then reads
//! everything back. Last it fills the volume: one file written until a write
//! answers `ENOSPC`, which must be the answer -- not `EIO` -- with the
//! volume still whole afterwards: the sync keeps what was written, the tree
//! reads back again, and deleting the file makes room for a new one. A dd
//! into a nearly full /data once latched the whole mount into `EIO`. That is the point of the check: after the unmount nothing
//! of the tree is in memory, so every byte compared comes off the disk,
//! through the driver, the block ring, the volume reader and its checksums.
//! What the guest cannot judge — whether the trees it wrote are the trees
//! btrfs would have written — is `btrfs check` on the host, which `xtask
//! test-btrfs` runs over the same image after the boot.
