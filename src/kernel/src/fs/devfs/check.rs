//! Stage 8's self-check of the block registry devfs keeps for stage 11.
//!
//! A mount will find its disk through [`devfs::block_device`], and a program
//! will find the same disk as a node in `/dev` and a row in
//! `/proc/partitions`. The check registers a small in-memory disk and holds
//! all three to what Linux shows: the node listed after the character nodes,
//! with a listing in pieces neither repeating nor skipping a name across a
//! registration; `statx` reporting a block device with the registered number
//! and, as Linux does, a size of zero; `O_PATH` opening it; the disk found
//! by number and its sectors read back; exactly its row in
//! `/proc/partitions`; clashing names and numbers refused, in order; and,
//! once the registration is dropped, the node, the lookup and the row gone
//! while the `Arc` still held answers `EIO` and does not panic.
//!
//! In between, the disk opened as a file (`fs::disk_file`, the installer's
//! way to a disk): `pread` of a range that starts and ends inside sectors,
//! `lseek` to the end, short reads at and over the end, the `BLK*` requests,
//! and `O_RDWR` refused because the disk is read-only. Then a writable disk
//! in memory: `pwrite` of a range that patches two sectors in part, a write
//! over the end cut short and one at the end refused, `fsync` reaching the
//! disk's flush, and every byte read back.
//!
//! The calls a program makes go in by number, from a process built for the
//! check, as `fs::check::run_calls` makes them. Like that check it runs
//! twice and counts frames and cached dentries across the second run, which
//! must leave neither behind. It assumes it is the only registrant at boot:
//! no driver has registered a disk before stage 8's checks run.
