//! The boot check for what this architecture decides on its own from values
//! the machine hands it.
//!
//! Stage 3's trap check proves the entry path with two breakpoints and three
//! page faults, which is every syndrome an ordinary boot raises. The decoding
//! behind it has more to say: a misaligned program counter or stack pointer, a
//! trapped floating-point exception, a class the architecture has not
//! allocated. Each is required here to become the trap and the signal Linux
//! raises for it (`arch/arm64/kernel/traps.c` and `mm/fault.c`), from a frame
//! built with that syndrome, because a program that raises one is a program
//! the kernel's own checks do not carry. The rest is the same kind of thing:
//!
//! * the `console=` value a loader names a `ramoops` zone or a 16550 with,
//!   read or refused -- the Pixel 7's console and its crosvm guest's, whose
//!   parsers are the one part of either a machine with a PL011 can run;
//! * how much entropy firmware's TRNG gives, from firmware scripted to answer
//!   as one with a TRNG does, and as ones without it, with an old SMCCC or
//!   with nothing ready do -- answers the machine the check runs on never
//!   gives, since `QEMU`'s firmware has no TRNG;
//! * which driver a GIC firmware describes with version zero gets;
//! * rewinding a system call a signal interrupted, and pointing one whose
//!   restart is `restart_syscall`'s at that call;
//! * masking a line at the controller and letting it through again, which a
//!   device whose driver holds its interrupt relies on, read back from the
//!   distributor or this core's redistributor, a shared line and a private
//!   one;
//! * the refusals: an identifier the controller does not have, a `GICv2m`
//!   frame at address zero or naming a range that is not shared peripheral
//!   interrupts, and on a GICv3 a device ID past the ITS's device table.
//!
//! Every frame, line and request is made for the check and given back: the
//! lines were ones nothing had enabled, and are left that way.
