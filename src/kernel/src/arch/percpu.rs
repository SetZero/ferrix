//! A word of this processor's own record, read and changed so that finding
//! the record and touching the word are one step a migration cannot come
//! between: for the preemption count every kernel spin lock raises
//! (`sched::preempt`, docs/OPAQUE-KERNEL.md §9.8 2b).
//!
//! * **x86-64: one instruction.** A `mov` from, or an `xadd` without `lock`
//!   to, `gs:[offset]` (`x86_64::cpu::read_gs_at`, `gs_xadd`). The processor
//!   resolves `GS` and makes the access as one instruction, so an interrupt is
//!   taken before it or after it. No `lock`, because only this processor
//!   writes the word.
//!
//!   Every path that can reach the word runs on the kernel's `GS` base
//!   (condition 2 of the consultant's 2026-10-02 review). The ordinary
//!   interrupt and exception stub decides `swapgs` from the saved `CS`, which
//!   is right for everything the kernel can hold off: every ring-0 stretch on
//!   the program's `GS` (the `SYSCALL` trampoline's two ends, the way out to
//!   a program and its resume, the trap stub's own return, and
//!   `load_gs_index`'s pair of `swapgs`) runs with interrupts masked and holds
//!   no instruction that can fault. The paranoid entries -- the NMI, `#DB`,
//!   `#MC` and `#DF` -- decide from `GS_BASE` itself before any Rust runs, so
//!   one taken inside the `SYSCALL` stub before its `swapgs`, or between
//!   `load_gs_index`'s two, swaps to the kernel's base; and their handlers
//!   take no lock that raises the count in any case: the NMI and a kernel
//!   `#DB` count into atomics and return, `#MC` and `#DF` never return, and a
//!   ring-3 `#DB` moves to the task's stack and the ordinary path.
//! * **AArch64 and ARMv7-A: masked.** The record's address comes from
//!   `TPIDR_EL1` or `TPIDRPRW` and the access is a load and a store, so the
//!   three are made with every asynchronous exception masked, through
//!   [`super::Irq`]: `daifset #0xf` (debug, `SError`, `IRQ`, `FIQ`) and
//!   `cpsid aif` (asynchronous abort, `IRQ`, `FIQ`). No pseudo-NMI is
//!   configured on AArch64: the GIC's priority mask is only ever written fully
//!   open and no interrupt is given NMI priority, so nothing the mask leaves
//!   open runs code that could take a lock. The span touches only the record,
//!   mapped since boot, and raises no synchronous exception.
//!
//! On ARMv7-A the word is two `u32` halves, low first, each loaded and stored
//! whole, so that another processor reading either reads a number this one
//! wrote, never half of one.
