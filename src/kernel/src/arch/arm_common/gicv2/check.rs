//! Two cores changing neighbouring lines of the distributor at once lose
//! neither change (F-50).
//!
//! A priority or target register holds four lines' bytes and a configuration
//! register sixteen lines' bits, so each change to one line is a read, a
//! change and a write of a word other lines share. [`super::rmw`] holds a lock
//! across the three. This check is what shows that it does: two cores make an
//! SPI edge-triggered and enable it -- `msi_allocate`'s order, configuration
//! before enable as the architecture asks -- on neighbouring SPIs at the same
//! moment, and every line must come out with its priority, target and
//! configuration set. The race is not left to chance: while the check runs,
//! [`super::WIDEN_SPINS`] holds each core between its read and its write, so
//! that without the lock both read before either writes and one core's write
//! puts back what the other had changed, every round.
//!
//! The lines are ones nothing can own: the highest sixteen SPIs, one
//! configuration word, that no device node names, no handler is registered
//! on, the `GICv2m` frame does not hand out, and nothing has enabled. After
//! every round their priority, target, configuration and pending state go back
//! to what they were, read back, and they are left disabled.
