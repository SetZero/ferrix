//! Message-signalled interrupts on x86-64: a local APIC vector per message.
//!
//! An MSI on a PC is a write to the local APIC's fixed address range. There
//! is no controller line to program and nothing to enable: the vector is
//! taken from a range nothing else uses, and a device that writes the
//! message raises it.
//!
//! **Where a VT-d unit remaps interrupts** (`docs/NVIDIA.md` §12.3, N0g),
//! the message names an entry in the unit's interrupt remapping table -- the
//! vector's slot among the sixty-four is its index -- which holds the vector,
//! the destination, and the requester ID the message must arrive with; the
//! unit refuses a message in compatibility format, and one naming the entry
//! from any other function. Where no unit remaps, the message carries the
//! vector itself, in compatibility format, as before.
