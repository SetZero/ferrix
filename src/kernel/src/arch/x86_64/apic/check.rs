//! Check R8 of `docs/NVIDIA.md` §12.3 (condition G6): every processor looks

//!
//! No firmware QEMU boots leaves a processor in x2APIC mode, so the check
//! puts the first application processor to arrive there itself, where the
//! processor offers x2APIC (CPUID leaf 1, `ECX` bit 21), before that
//! processor's own look: it must report "switched to xAPIC" and come up.
