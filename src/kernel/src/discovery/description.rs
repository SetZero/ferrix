//! Which of its two descriptions a machine is read by.
//!
//! A machine describes itself with ACPI tables, with a device tree, or --
//! on AArch64 under EDK2 -- with both, and where both are there the ACPI
//! tables are authoritative. Everything that finds devices, the IOMMUs and
//! the PCI hosts asks this first, and [`of`] is the one place it is answered.
//! The decision itself is `ferrix_description::choose`, tested on the host
//! for every combination; this opens the two for it.
//!
//! Code that only ever reads the tree -- the console, the timers, the other
//! processors, a board's own peripherals -- opens it with [`fdt::open`]
//! directly, as before: on those machines it is the only description there
//! is.
