//! A way of finding devices: the one interface the PCI walk, the device
//! tree's `virtio,mmio` nodes and the boards' bindings implement.
//!
//! [`device::publish`](crate::device::publish) runs the finders it is given
//! in order, then checks and publishes what they found. The contract:
//!
//! * **What a finder returns is untrusted.** Its nodes are firmware's and a
//!   device's description, as a finder read it. `publish` takes an aperture
//!   away from any node whose aperture an earlier node already holds, and
//!   checks every node -- exactly its apertures, its vectors, nothing shared
//!   -- as it did before there were finders. A finder cannot publish a node
//!   `publish` would refuse.
//! * **Order is precedence.** Finders run in the order given, and an earlier
//!   finder's node keeps an aperture a later one also claims. The boot gives
//!   the PCI walk, then the tree's nodes, then the boards'.
//! * **A failure stops discovery.** A finder that fails ends the run before
//!   any later finder runs and before anything is published, and the boot
//!   halts on it, as a failed PCI walk always has. The tree's and the
//!   boards' finders fail only on running out of memory: what they cannot
//!   use they leave alone and say why.
//! * **Only publish makes a node count.** `DeviceNode::empty` and `mint`
//!   are crate-visible so that finders outside `device` can build nodes,
//!   and that is safe because a node reaches a driver only through
//!   `publish`, which runs once at boot and refuses a second call before
//!   touching anything: a node built anywhere else can never be published.
//!   A change that wants to publish a node later has to argue with this.
//! * **Allocation is fallible.** A node is added to the list with
//!   `fallible::try_push`, and running out of memory is a failure like any
//!   other.
//!
//! The core defines this and knows no finder: the item's PCI walk implements
//! it, and `main.rs` hands the finders to `publish`. A finder keeps its own
//! failure and lends it as something to print, so the core names no finder's
//! error type.
