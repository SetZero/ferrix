//! Pins: pages of a VMO a device may reach, held until the handle is closed.
//!
//! `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 gives a driver "a `Vmo` for DMA, whose device
//! addresses come from an IOMMU domain scoped to that device". A pin is that
//! grant. `Vmo::hold` keeps the pages where they are, and the device's domain
//! maps them and says at which addresses the device reaches them.
//!
//! # The order a pin is given back in
//!
//! Out of the domain, and forgotten by the unit, first; only then are the
//! holds released and the frames free to go. On a translated domain that is
//! the whole story. On an untranslated one the device can still reach the
//! frames once they are unpinned, since nothing stands between it and
//! memory -- but it can reach every other frame too: such a domain is the
//! degraded trusted mode of VULNERABILITY-ANALYSIS V-03, where the driver is
//! trusted with all of memory. Keeping a live driver's closed pin there
//! protects nothing its device could not reach anyway, so it is given back
//! at once, as on a translated domain (finding F-59; before it, such pins
//! were kept for good, a leak, and since the pin budget a device that stopped
//! after enough attaches). A pin its domain refuses to give back keeps its
//! frames for good, and the console says so the first time.
//!
//! # The quarantine
//!
//! On a translated domain the unit forgets a page before its frame goes
//! ([`Domain::unpin`] waits for the invalidation to complete), which is all a
//! device with no translation cache of its own needs (ATS is never enabled:
//! `docs/certification/SAFETY-MANUAL.md`, AoU-12). An emulator can reach
//! further. QEMU maps a virtqueue buffer's memory when the device takes the
//! buffer and writes its status through that mapping when it hands the buffer
//! back, whatever the domain says by then. virtio-snd holds buffers across its
//! driver's death, and its reset leaves them queued (`docs/AUDIO.md` §3.3).
//! So the frames of a pin closed because its process died could be written
//! after they were freed, into whatever took them next: a driver started
//! again at once is given them. On an untranslated domain nothing forgets
//! anything, and the same late write lands wherever the frame went next.
//!
//! So such a pin, on either kind of domain, goes to a quarantine instead of being given back: its pages
//! stay mapped in the domain and its frames held, charged to nobody, since
//! the job they were charged to is gone. What the device writes late lands in
//! the dead driver's own pages, reached as the domain still allows, and
//! neither faults nor reaches memory anything else holds. An untranslated
//! domain has nothing to unmap: its quarantined pin is only its frames, held
//! (F-59). The pin is given
//! back, out of the domain first and then to the allocator, once the device's
//! core accepts a new driver's HELLO for it ([`quarantine_release`]). A driver resets its device in its bring-up,
//! before HELLO, and virtio-snd's also releases what the device held. That is
//! an event the device's own protocol orders, not a time. A device no driver
//! takes up again keeps its quarantine for good. That is bounded by what devmgr starts: it starts no
//! driver again after one that died before publishing, which is after its
//! HELLO was accepted, or after its restart budget is spent (`docs/DEVMGR.md`
//! §4). So a device's quarantine holds at most the pins of the last driver
//! that published and of the one after it that died before publishing, and
//! one more driver's for each explicit rebind an administrator asks of a
//! device whose drivers keep dying so (SAFETY-MANUAL AoU-12). The kernel does
//! not rely on that: see the budget below.
//!
//! # The budget
//!
//! Each device has a pin budget `B`, in pages ([`PinBudget`], kept on its
//! domain, `docs/NVIDIA.md` §12.2): [`DEFAULT_PIN_BUDGET_PAGES`] until
//! `devmgr`, which alone holds `SET_LIMIT` on the device, sets another
//! ([`set_budget`]). Against it three counts are kept, each read and changed
//! only under [`QUARANTINE`]'s lock: `live`, the pages of the device's pins
//! still open, reserved before the domain is asked to map them ([`reserve`])
//! and given back if it refuses; `quarantined`, the pages its quarantine
//! holds; and `kept`, the pages kept for good because the domain would not
//! give them back, or a dead driver's pin could not be quarantined. A pin of `n`
//! pages is refused, with nothing mapped, when `live + n > B`
//! ([`PinError::LimitReached`]), and when `quarantined + kept + live + n >
//! 2B` ([`PinError::QuarantineFull`]). A death moves pages from `live` to
//! `quarantined` or `kept` and never adds to the sum, and a release takes off
//! `quarantined` only what it gave back, so the memory a device's pins hold
//! never passes `2B`: two drivers' worth, the last that published and one
//! that died before publishing. A budget raised above the default is
//! counted against the kernel's ceiling, a quarter of RAM ([`ceiling`]); the
//! default is not, as it is the per-device bound AoU-12 accepts.
//!
//! Until the release, a quarantined page stays reachable by its device, and
//! so by that device's next driver, which is the dead one's successor in the
//! same trust domain; nothing else can reach it. Once released, a frame is
//! zeroed before a new owner can read it, as every frame handed to a VMO is
//! (O.SCRUB). A pin closed by a live driver is not quarantined: a live
//! driver resets its device before it unpins, as the ring specifications say.
