//! Interrupts: a device's vector, delivered to the driver that holds it.
//!
//! `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 gives a driver "an `Interrupt` object per
//! vector". It is built only from a [`Vector`], which only `crate::device`
//! can make, so a driver cannot claim a line its device does not have.
//!
//! # Masked from delivery to acknowledgement, where it must be
//!
//! When the line fires, the kernel's handler marks the object pending. The
//! driver sees `READABLE`, services the device, and acknowledges, which clears
//! pending. A line the interrupt controller holds -- level-triggered, or one
//! whose trigger firmware left unsaid -- is also masked by every delivery and
//! unmasked by the acknowledgement. A device that keeps such a line asserted
//! therefore cannot keep a processor in the handler, and a driver that has
//! wedged costs one masked line rather than an interrupt storm.
//!
//! An edge-triggered MSI-X vector is not masked per delivery. Its entry lives
//! in the device's table, so masking and unmasking are two writes to device
//! memory per interrupt -- under a hypervisor, two exits to the emulator for
//! every block read. It needs neither: a message is an edge, it does not stay
//! asserted, and a delivery while the line is pending changes nothing, since
//! `pending` coalesces it into the packet already queued. A delivery between
//! the driver's acknowledgement and its drain is not lost either, because the
//! acknowledgement clears pending first and that delivery queues a packet of
//! its own.
//!
//! What such a vector keeps is a stated bound on what a device may cost the
//! processor between two acknowledgements: at most [`STORM_BOUND`] deliveries
//! reach the handler, each a lock, two atomics and no wake once the line is
//! pending, and the time is charged to whichever task the interrupt cut, as
//! every interrupt's is. The delivery past the bound masks the entry, and the
//! acknowledgement that follows unmasks it. A driver that wedges therefore
//! costs [`STORM_BOUND`] handler runs and one masked line, not a storm. The
//! bound is counted per acknowledgement rather than per unit of time because
//! the acknowledgement is what the holder controls: a device raising
//! completions as fast as its driver takes them is a working device, and one
//! raising them while nobody listens is the storm.
//!
//! # What an interrupt handler may do
//!
//! Take interrupt-safe locks, and wake. The handler marks the object pending
//! and queues its port's packet under interrupt-safe locks only, lets go of
//! them, and then wakes whoever waits on the interrupt and on the port.
//! `WaitQueue::wake_all` may be called from a handler: its own lock and every
//! run queue's are taken with interrupts masked, it allocates nothing, and it
//! leaves the reschedule to the way out of the interrupt or to an IPI. What it
//! must not be called with is a lock it needs already held, which is why the
//! binding's lock is released first. A plain `SpinLock` is still never taken
//! here.
//!
//! # Holding the object is holding the line
//!
//! A claim lasts exactly as long as the [`Interrupt`], which only handles, and
//! messages carrying them, keep alive. When the last of those goes the line is
//! free by the time the close returns, because `object::dispose` drops an
//! interrupt on the spot, and a driver restarted after its predecessor died
//! can claim it straight away.
//!
//! A delivery never holds the claim. The handler takes the claimed [`Line`] --
//! the pending mark, the binding and the waiters -- and fires that, so a holder
//! that lets go while a delivery runs on another processor frees the line at
//! once, and the delivery finishes against state nobody can reach any more: at
//! most one packet on the port the old holder had bound it to. The claim used
//! to be the object itself, found through a weak reference the handler
//! upgraded, and a delivery preempted holding that reference made an immediate
//! re-claim of the line fail (`FX-0901`).
//!
//! Finding a line and masking it are one step under [`BOUND`]'s lock, and so
//! are giving a line up and masking it. Otherwise a delivery that found the old
//! holder, or the old holder's own drop, could mask the line after a new holder
//! had claimed and unmasked it, and the new driver would never hear its device
//! again.
//!
//! # One kernel handler per line, for good
//!
//! `irq` has no way to take a handler back out, so the first `Interrupt` on a
//! line registers [`on_interrupt`] and it stays registered for the life of the
//! machine. The handler finds the line through [`BOUND`]; a line nobody holds
//! is masked and left alone.
