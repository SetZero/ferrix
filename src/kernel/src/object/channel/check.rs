//! A channel end's state word equals its inbox (`docs/OPAQUE-KERNEL.md` §9.8,
//! 2e): every operation that changes whether an inbox is empty, in a long
//! pseudo-random order on one pair, with the word compared to the inbox
//! under its lock after each, and the close's mark compared to the peer's
//! `closed` at the end.
//!
//! A boot check rather than a host test, because `Inbox` and `Half` are the
//! kernel's own and only the kernel builds them.
