//! I/O mappings: a device's registers, mappable into a driver's address
//! space, and nothing outside them.
//!
//! `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 gives a driver "an `IoMapping` for each BAR or
//! MMIO window, and nothing outside it". The "nothing outside" is enforced
//! before this module is reached: an [`IoMapping`] is built only from an
//! [`Aperture`], and only `crate::device` can make one, from what enumeration
//! found. This module's own rule is the one a page table forces on top.
//!
//! # Whole pages, or refused
//!
//! A mapping is made of pages, and an aperture need not be. QEMU's ARM
//! machines pack their virtio-mmio transports 0x200 bytes apart, several to a
//! page, so rounding an aperture out to its page would hand a driver its
//! neighbours' registers as well as its own — exactly what the aperture type
//! exists to prevent. So an aperture that is not a whole number of pages is
//! refused rather than rounded. Sub-page apertures need trapping each access,
//! which is a later story; drivers on those machines use virtio-pci, whose
//! BARs are whole pages.
