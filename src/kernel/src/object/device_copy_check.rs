//! A copy through a device's pages is refused, and the boot goes on (F-55).
//!
//! A program that maps device memory -- a driver's aperture through an I/O
//! mapping, a render node's window of host memory -- can hand a pointer into
//! it to any system call that copies. The kernel copies through the direct
//! map, which translates RAM alone, so for a device's page the alias it would
//! form is either nothing, and the copy faults in the kernel, or a cacheable
//! alias of memory the program maps uncached. Until copies go through a
//! mapping with the device's own attributes, both directions are `EFAULT`,
//! decided from the region before its page is faulted in.
//!
//! The windows are an aperture a device node really has, through the native
//! objects a driver uses; a cached window past all RAM, where Venus's host
//! window lay when the panic was found; and, where the memory map has one, a
//! window over a hole between two runs of RAM, inside the direct map's span.
//! Only the aperture's page is ever faulted in, and nothing reads or writes
//! any of them.
