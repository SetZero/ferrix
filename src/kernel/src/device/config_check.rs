//! Stage 10's checks of a driver's configuration window and of
//! `device_aperture` (`docs/NVIDIA.md` §12.1, checks W1 to W7), on the
//! published nodes, through the native calls a driver makes.
//!
//! * W1: `device_aperture` answers every aperture of every node as minted,
//!   and an aperture above 4 GiB and longer than 4 GiB -- QEMU's
//!   `pci-testdev,membar=8G`, which xtask's x86-64 machine carries -- whole.
//! * W2: reads of every header field a node keeps answer what enumeration
//!   read, and reads of the MSI and MSI-X capabilities and of extended space
//!   are answered.
//! * W4: writes to the command register, a BAR, the MSI and MSI-X
//!   capabilities, PCI Express's Device Control, a device-dependent byte no
//!   capability covers and ATS, where the machine has it, are each refused
//!   and read back unchanged.
//! * W5: a write spanning a kernel-owned and a writable byte is refused
//!   whole; an unaligned access, a width of three and offset 0x1000 are
//!   malformed.
//! * W3: a write to a driver-writable field, virtio's
//!   `VIRTIO_PCI_CAP_PCI_CFG` `offset`, reads back as written; a write to
//!   its `pci_cfg_data` is refused.
//! * W6: bus mastering switched on and off on one processor while another
//!   writes a driver-writable byte of the same function, 1,000 rounds, reads
//!   back as `dma_on` says every time.
//! * W7: a command register rewritten behind the kernel, as a driver could
//!   through a configuration mirror in a BAR, is found by `verify_config`:
//!   bus mastering goes off, the node answers `BAD_STATE`, the line names
//!   `COMMAND`, and an `enable_dma` after it is refused and leaves bus
//!   mastering off. And before it, every node reads back as minted.
//!
//! W4 and W5 run before W3 so that a control loosening the allowlist is
//! caught by the check it is the control of.
