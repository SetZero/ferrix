//! A 32-bit program's system call arguments, rewritten into the layout the
//! handlers read (`docs/I386.md` §3.2, I3).
//!
//! The entry zero-extends each of an i386 call's six registers, which is
//! right for every `int`, `unsigned` and pointer argument: the handlers
//! narrow an `int` themselves. Two kinds of argument are not right that way,
//! and both are the register layout rather than a structure in memory:
//!
//! * **A 64-bit value** (`loff_t`, a `u64`) arrives in two registers, low
//!   word first, with no alignment to an even register -- Linux's
//!   `compat_arg_u64` on x86 and its `ia32_*` wrappers in
//!   `arch/x86/kernel/sys_ia32.c`, unlike ARMv7-A's EABI. It is joined into
//!   one argument and the ones after it move up, so the handler sees the
//!   64-bit prototype.
//! * **A signed `long`** (`off_t`) is 32 bits and has to be sign-extended, or
//!   `lseek(fd, -1, SEEK_CUR)` would seek four gigabytes forward.
//!
//! After this, `linux::wide` and `linux::native_signed` read the arguments as
//! they would a 64-bit program's. A call that passes a structure in memory
//! instead asks its handler to read it at the call's word width, and
//! [`ioctl_passes`] keeps back the `ioctl` requests no handler reads that way
//! yet. [`socketcall`] turns i386's one socket entry into the call it names.
