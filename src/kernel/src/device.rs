//! Stage 10: device nodes, and the only way to name a device's registers or
//! interrupts.
//!
//! A driver in ring 3 gets an `IoMapping` for each of its device's apertures
//! "and nothing outside it", and an `Interrupt` for each of its vectors
//! (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §7). Checking a driver's request against what the
//! device has is one comparison, and a comparison is a thing somebody can
//! forget to make. So the comparison is a type instead: an [`Aperture`] or a
//! [`Vector`] can only be constructed here, from what enumeration found, and
//! the objects a driver is handed take those rather than addresses and
//! numbers. A request for memory the device does not decode has no way to
//! become an `Aperture`, so it has no way to become a mapping.
//!
//! # Which devices get a node
//!
//! Every PCI function enumeration found, and every `virtio,mmio` node of a
//! device tree on a machine without ACPI tables. The device tree is an
//! allowlist rather than a walk of every node with a `reg`, because most of
//! those nodes are devices the kernel drives itself — the console, the
//! interrupt controller, the timer — and a node for one of them would let a
//! driver map the kernel's own registers.
//!
//! The rest of the allowlist is board support's: a peripheral a board has to
//! clock and take out of reset before a driver can have it, prepared by a
//! [`BoardBinding`] the board registered at bring-up. The registry does not
//! name any board -- board support is outside the certified item -- and mints
//! what a binding hands back under the same rules as any other node.
//!
//! # What an aperture may not overlap
//!
//! A BAR's address is whatever the register holds, and a device tree's `reg`
//! is whatever somebody wrote; neither is proof the range is the device's. So
//! an aperture is withheld rather than minted when it overlaps anything
//! [`Reserved`] names — every region of the memory map except firmware's own
//! descriptions of device memory, every ECAM window, every device window the
//! kernel has mapped for itself, every IOMMU's registers, the device tree's
//! console and the boot framebuffer — or an aperture another node already
//! holds. A BAR of a
//! function whose memory decoding is off is not an aperture at all: nothing
//! says firmware placed it.
//!
//! # Vectors
//!
//! A device tree node's vectors are its interrupt specifiers, screened: only
//! shared peripheral interrupts, none the kernel has registered a handler on,
//! and none another node already holds.
//!
//! A PCI function's vectors are its MSI-X table entries, minted the first time
//! one is asked for rather than at boot, because each takes a vector from the
//! architecture's allocator and a machine has few to spend on devices nobody
//! drives. The first mint masks every entry and turns MSI-X on; each mint
//! programs its entry, still masked, and the vector belongs to that entry for
//! the life of the machine. Minting does not turn bus mastering on, and a
//! message is a write the device makes, so nothing arrives until whoever gives
//! the device DMA does that.
//!
//! A PCI function with no MSI-X table but an MSI capability gets one vector
//! from it, minted the same way: `INTx` off, the message programmed and
//! masked. Ampere GPUs signal this way (`docs/NVIDIA.md` §2.3).
//!
//! Masking an MSI-X vector is a write to its entry's mask bit, and masking an
//! MSI vector a write to its capability's mask bit, or its enable bit where it
//! has none. The interrupt controller can reach neither, so [`Vector::mask`]
//! knows which kind it is. It takes no lock: an interrupt handler calls it.
