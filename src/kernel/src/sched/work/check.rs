//! The wake row, checked (`docs/OPAQUE-KERNEL.md` §9.8, 2c case 10).
//!
//! A wake reads its target's state only under the run-queue lock of the
//! processor that owns the target: step 4's fast path will read its task's
//! [`END`](super::END) under that lock and block in the same hold, with no
//! fence, and is safe only because a waker cannot decide "runnable, nothing
//! to do" without that lock. The general path does not show it: its waits
//! order a kill against their last look with a fence pair, so an early exit
//! in the wake would lose none of their wakes. So this does what the fast
//! path will do, with a check-only blocker:
//!
//! 1. The blocker takes its home queue's lock, reads its `END` bit, says it
//!    is ready, and waits with the lock held until the poster on another
//!    processor is at its wake -- [`super::notify`]'s hook says so, between
//!    the post and the wake -- and a little longer, so that the poster's wake
//!    is under way. Then it marks itself blocked, lets the lock go, and
//!    switches out.
//! 2. The poster posts `END` to it through [`super::notify`].
//!
//! With the row kept, the poster's wake waits for the lock, finds the blocker
//! blocked or about to switch out, and makes it runnable: the blocker comes
//! back within the bound. A wake that read the state before the lock would
//! have found it runnable, done nothing, and left it blocked for good.
//!
//! The hook follows §9.7 condition 11's rules: set only here, in stage 9,
//! disarmed before this returns whatever it found, and required disarmed
//! after stage 9 ([`super::hook_armed_by`], FX-0908).
