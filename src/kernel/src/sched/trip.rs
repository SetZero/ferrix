//! Where one trip through the block ring spends its time: stamps along the
//! path a read takes, and counts of what the path did (`docs/OPAQUE-KERNEL.md`,
//! S0).
//!
//! The seam check (`interfaces::block_ring::hop_check`) times a read from its
//! call to its answer, which says how long a trip takes and not where the time
//! goes. While that check's depth-1 run is going, and only then, [`TRACING`]
//! is up, and each point the read passes writes the processor's counter and
//! its own number into its slot:
//!
//! | Stamp | Where |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`Stamp::Issued`] | the check calls the read |
//! | [`Stamp::Queued`] | the read is on the disk's queue, before the ring's task is nudged |
//! | [`Stamp::RingRunning`] | the ring's task is running after its sleep |
//! | [`Stamp::OnRing`] | the command is on the ring |
//! | [`Stamp::Bell`] | the ring rings the driver |
//! | [`Stamp::DriverBell`] | the driver's `port_wait` takes the bell |
//! | [`Stamp::Irq`] | the device's interrupt queues its packet on the driver's port |
//! | [`Stamp::DriverIrq`] | the driver's `port_wait` takes that packet |
//! | [`Stamp::Posted`] | the driver rings the ring's port with the completion |
//! | [`Stamp::RingAgain`] | the ring's task is running again |
//! | [`Stamp::Answered`] | the ring has copied the answer out for the reader |
//! | [`Stamp::Reader`] | the reader is running again |
//! | [`Stamp::Done`] | the read has returned to the check |
//!
//! Everywhere else a stamp point costs one relaxed load of [`TRACING`], and
//! so does each count. Nothing here allocates or takes a lock: the slots are
//! atomics, and the check copies them out after each read.
//!
//! # Order, and hops a trip did not take
//!
//! A point stamps only when the trip has reached it: [`NEXT`] is the slot the
//! trip expects next, and each point names the earliest slot it may follow.
//! Most must follow directly. A few hops happen only when something was
//! asleep: a ring task already running is not woken, and a driver already
//! awake is not rung. So [`Stamp::OnRing`] may follow [`Stamp::Queued`], the
//! interrupt may follow the ring's bell or the command itself, and so on. A
//! slot passed over takes the time and processor of the stamp before it, so
//! its hop reads as zero and the hop after it carries the time, and the trip
//! records it in its skipped mask. A trip whose [`Stamp::Done`] finds an
//! earlier slot unreached is incomplete, and the check leaves it out.
//!
//! Since the ring's task left the data path (`docs/BLOCK-RING.md` §5, os-35),
//! no trip takes either of its stamps: the reader puts its command on the
//! ring and rings the driver itself, stamping [`Stamp::OnRing`] and
//! [`Stamp::Bell`] in its own time, and the driver's `port_queue` answers the
//! read, stamping [`Stamp::Posted`] and then [`Stamp::Answered`]. So
//! [`Stamp::RingRunning`] and [`Stamp::RingAgain`] are passed over on every
//! trip, and the `seam-trip` line counts them among the hops not taken.
//!
//! Which disk and which ports are the traced ones is recorded as the trip
//! goes: [`Stamp::Queued`] names the disk by the address of its reader's wait
//! queue, and [`Stamp::OnRing`] the ring's two ports by the addresses of
//! theirs. A point on another disk or another port does not match, and does
//! not stamp.
//!
//! The processor's number is read with interrupts masked, with the counter,
//! so the two belong to the same processor.
