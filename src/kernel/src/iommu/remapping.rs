//! Interrupt remapping on VT-d (`docs/NVIDIA.md` §12.3, N0g): which units
//! remap, the conversion of the one interrupt line that is live before they
//! do, how a function's messages are routed, and when a machine's
//! interrupts are isolated.
//!
//! # Why the architecture registers hooks here
//!
//! `iommu` is shared by every architecture and names none of them
//! (`arch`'s facade rule), and remapping is x86-64's alone, with nothing for
//! Arm to provide (condition G7). So x86-64 registers what bring-up needs of
//! it -- the vectors it has handed out, and its console's I/O APIC line --
//! through [`note_hooks`], from the console's interrupt set-up at stage 3,
//! and the functions an x86-64 caller alone reaches carry an `expect`
//! of dead code elsewhere.
//!
//! # Bring-up, per unit that can remap
//!
//! After the unit's queue and table are up ([`vtd::Unit::enable`]):
//!
//! 1. **The console's line, if this unit's DMAR scope names its I/O APIC.**
//!    It has been live in compatibility format since stage 3. It is masked;
//!    a fresh vector `V1` is taken; an entry is written for it, with the
//!    destination the line is routed to now and the I/O APIC's source ID,
//!    and invalidated. The old vector `V0` stays taken for good, so its
//!    entry index is never present.
//! 2. **No compatibility-format vector exists** (check R9): every vector
//!    handed out is the console's `V0` or `V1`. Message vectors are minted
//!    at stage 10, after this; one minted before would pass through, so the
//!    boot stops by name.
//! 3. `IRE`, and `CFIS` read back clear ([`vtd::Unit::start_remapping`]).
//! 4. The line's handler moves to `V1` through the generic interrupt layer,
//!    its entry is rewritten in remappable format naming `V1`'s entry with
//!    `V1` as its vector, it is unmasked, and the port is serviced once.
//!
//! The line is masked before it is rewritten, which under KVM's split
//! irqchip is required: QEMU recomputes a KVM route only on an entry or
//! message write or an invalidation, never on `IRE`, and a refused
//! recomputation leaves the old route delivering. A delivery on `V0` after
//! this is counted, and fails the boot.
//!
//! When no unit's scope names the console's I/O APIC, the line cannot be
//! converted and console input cannot go back to polling, so no unit
//! remaps: the line stays as it is and the machine's interrupts are not
//! isolated.
