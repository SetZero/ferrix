//! Intel VT-d in legacy mode: a remapping unit's root and context tables, and
//! the second-level tables of the domains built on it.
//!
//! Written against the specification and checked against QEMU's
//! `hw/i386/intel_iommu.c`, which the boot test runs. Legacy mode needs, and
//! this does:
//!
//! * a **root table**, one entry per bus, pointing at that bus's **context
//!   table**, one entry per device and function, which names a domain and the
//!   root of its second-level tables — `src/lib/kernel/paging`'s [`VtdSecondLevel`],
//!   three levels over 39 bits;
//! * **queued invalidation** of the context cache and the IOTLB, after
//!   anything the unit may have cached changes (below);
//! * **translation on**, after which a function with no context entry reaches
//!   nothing at all.
//!
//! # A unit whose walk does not snoop
//!
//! A unit with `ECAP.C` clear reads its root, context and second-level
//! entries from memory, past every processor's cache, and this kernel writes
//! them through the cached direct map. So on such a unit every entry written
//! is noted in an [`Unpublished`] record and cleaned to memory --
//! `clflush`, then `mfence` ([`crate::arch::clean_for_walker`]) -- before
//! the invalidation that publishes it, and a fresh table is cleaned whole
//! before anything links it ([`table`]). Each change checks its record is
//! empty at its own publish point -- the invalidation that publishes an
//! attach or a detach, the return of a map or an unmap -- and is refused if
//! it is not, so a write not cleaned is never published; what the checks
//! find is counted for stage 10's check (finding F-58). QEMU's unit reports
//! `C` clear, though it walks coherently, so every boot test runs this
//! path. A unit with `C` set is written as before, with nothing noted or
//! cleaned.
//!
//! What the check proves is that each change's noted writes were cleaned
//! before its own publish point. That every write to memory the unit walks
//! is noted rests on construction: [`write_entry`], [`table`] and the
//! mapper's writes through `ferrix_paging::coherence::Walked` (in
//! `mm::map_io` and `mm::unmap_io`) are this file's only writers of that
//! memory, and no other direct-map write is in it. `enable` and `flush`
//! write nothing, so their invalidations check no record: `enable` relies
//! on `open`'s clean of the root table, `flush` on `map`'s and `unmap`'s
//! own checks.
//!
//! # Queued invalidation, and only that
//!
//! Every invalidation goes through the unit's invalidation queue
//! (`docs/NVIDIA.md` §12.3, N0g): one descriptor and a fenced wait
//! descriptor behind it, whose status write -- a sequence number of the
//! unit's own, so a late completion of an earlier wait is never taken for
//! this one -- is what the kernel waits for, up to [`PATIENCE_NANOS`]. A
//! unit without `ECAP.QI` is refused, so there is no register-based
//! invalidation left to issue while `QIE` is set, which the specification
//! forbids. [`Unit::invalidate_context`] and [`Unit::invalidate_iotlb`] are
//! the only two entry points, so every caller -- an attach, a detach, a
//! flush after an unmap or a caching-mode map, the quarantine's release --
//! goes through the queue without a change at its call site.
//!
//! **A failed invalidation** is a wait whose status is not written within
//! the unit's patience, or `FSTS.IQE`, `ICE` or `ITE` seen while waiting.
//! It answers `Err`, and every caller already treats that as "the unit may
//! still reach it": an unpin hands the pin back and its frames are kept, a
//! detach keeps the root table. After `IQE` or `ITE` the unit has stopped
//! fetching descriptors, so it is marked **failed**: every later
//! invalidation on it fails at once without touching the queue, nothing is
//! released from its domains again until reboot, and the end-of-boot audit
//! counts the failure as a stray fault (FX-1007). There is no recovery: a
//! wedged queue is a broken unit, and holding memory is the safe side.
//!
//! Interrupt remapping and fault events are not used.
