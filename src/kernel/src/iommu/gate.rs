//! Waiting on a unit with interrupts on.
//!
//! A VT-d invalidation and an `SMMUv3` command are finished when the unit says
//! so: at once under QEMU, in microseconds on hardware, and only after a
//! unit's patience on one that is busy or broken. Every unpin from a
//! translated domain waits for one, and virtio-blk pins and unpins on its
//! request path, so the wait must not mask interrupts, as it did inside the
//! `IrqSpinLock`s it was first written under.
//!
//! * A [`Gate`] is what an operation holds across its wait instead: one
//!   domain's pins and unpins, or one unit's commands, one at a time. A task
//!   waiting to enter sleeps on a wait queue.
//! * [`poll`] is the wait itself: it looks at the unit, and between looks
//!   gives up the processor.
//!
//! Both need a context that may block: a task, on a processor taking
//! interrupts, with nothing holding preemption off. Anywhere else — before
//! the scheduler, or under a spin lock — they spin, as the locks did, and the
//! deadline still ends them. So a spinning waiter cannot hang on a holder
//! switched out on its own processor: its deadline answers an error, and the
//! caller keeps its pages rather than freeing what a unit may still reach.
