//! One memory type per page of device memory, across every user mapping.
//!
//! A device page reaches ring 3 three ways: `io_mapping_map` maps an
//! aperture as device memory (uncacheable), `io_mapping_map_combining` maps a
//! prefetchable one write-combining, and `mmap` of a render node's blob maps
//! a window of the device's memory cacheable when the device says it may be
//! cached (`syscall::memory::map_window`). Two of those over one page at once
//! are an alias of two memory types. The SDM (Vol. 3A §11.12.4) forbids a
//! write-combining page aliasing a cacheable one, because write-combining
//! stores need not snoop the caches, and the consequence can be a machine
//! check that is not confined to the device; on Arm, Normal non-cacheable
//! beside Normal write-back is a mismatched-attribute alias that loses
//! coherence. Uncacheable beside write-combining is not forbidden, but it
//! is not needed either, and one rule is easier to hold than two.
//!
//! So every user mapping of device memory holds a [`Hold`] on its physical
//! range for as long as any region of any address space maps it, and a
//! mapping whose type differs from a live hold's on any page of its range is
//! refused. The hold is kept beside the region's id, as a window's keeper
//! is, and dropped only after the unmap's shootdown has returned
//! (`AddressSpace::give_back`), so no processor can still hold a translation
//! of the old type when a mapping of the new one is allowed.
//!
//! The kernel's own mappings are not here, and need not be, because none of
//! them is of a page a user mapping can reach. Its direct map covers RAM runs
//! only (`mm::direct_map_ram`), and no aperture or window is RAM. The boot
//! framebuffer, which it maps write-combining itself, is in
//! `device::Reserved` with the interrupt controllers, timers and firmware's
//! own memory it maps, and an aperture overlapping anything reserved is
//! withheld rather than minted (`device.rs`). A PCI function's MSI-X table
//! and pending-bit pages, which the kernel maps to mint vectors, are cut out
//! of the function's apertures (`msix::withheld`). Configuration space is
//! not a BAR and is never an aperture.
//!
//! # A residual: cache lines across a type change
//!
//! The hold orders translations -- it goes only after the unmap's
//! shootdown -- but not caches. After the last region mapping a window
//! cached is gone, dirty write-back lines of its device pages may still be
//! in a processor's cache, and may be written back after a later
//! write-combining or uncached mapping of the same pages has written them
//! (SDM Vol. 3A 11.11.9 and 11.12.4 ask for a flush on a type change). No
//! two types are ever mapped at once, so this is no simultaneous alias and
//! has no machine-wide effect: the worst is stale data written over the
//! device's own memory, the memory of the device whose driver and clients
//! made both mappings. It is recorded, not flushed (VULNERABILITY-ANALYSIS
//! T.DMA, MEMORY-AND-TIMING 2.2f); flushing a cached range as its hold is
//! released would close it.
