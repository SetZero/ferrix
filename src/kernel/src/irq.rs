//! Device interrupts, once a controller is delivering them.
//!
//! The architectures number interrupts differently and acknowledge them
//! differently — x86-64 hands the kernel a vector and wants an end-of-interrupt
//! written to the local APIC afterwards; the GIC hands over an identifier that
//! must be given back to the same register it came from — so the acknowledge
//! protocol stays in `arch`, and what arrives here is the number and nothing
//! else.
//!
//! # Locking
//!
//! The table is behind an interrupt-masking lock, and [`dispatch`] holds it
//! only long enough to copy a function pointer out. The handler runs after the
//! lock is released, so two CPUs taking interrupts at once contend for a load
//! rather than waiting on each other's handlers.
//!
//! What a lock does not give is safe *removal*: a handler unregistered on one
//! CPU may still be running on another that copied it out a moment earlier.
//! Nothing is unregistered before stage 10, and `smp::synchronize` is what
//! will make it safe when something is — a running handler is a read-side
//! section, because it runs with interrupts masked, so taking a handler out of
//! the table and then waiting a grace period leaves nothing still running it.
