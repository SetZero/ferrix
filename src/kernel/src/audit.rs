//! The audit record: what the TSF decided, kept where only it writes
//! (finding F-21b, `docs/certification/AUDIT.md`).
//!
//! # What is kept
//!
//! One fixed 64-byte [`Record`] per event the kernel decided: a capability
//! refused, authority handed over, a process ended from outside, a device
//! quiesced, TSF data changed, and the boot's own configuration. Each is
//! recorded at the one place that decision is made, so recording it adds a
//! call and changes nothing about the decision. The layout is
//! `src/lib/proto/audit`'s, which a reader shares.
//!
//! # Where
//!
//! In two rings of static storage, so that nothing on a recording path
//! allocates (finding F-23) and a record can be taken before the heap is up:
//!
//! * the **high-value ring**, [`HIGH_RECORDS`] long, for every class but
//!   refusals: they are rare, and a flood of refusals can never evict one;
//! * the **refusal ring**, [`REFUSAL_RECORDS`] long, with fairness: past
//!   [`PER_BUDGET_PER_SECOND`] refusals charged to one budget in a second,
//!   that budget's further refusals are counted, not kept, and one
//!   *suppressed n* record says how many once its second has ended.
//!
//! # Whose budget
//!
//! A refusal is charged to its job's audit budget, [`Subject::budget`],
//! which each job carries from when it was made (`Job::audit_budget`): the
//! job at or above the refusing one that its members' own authority could
//! not have made. Its maker decides, since whether a directory is writable
//! by someone other than root is cgroupfs's to know: an anonymous job takes
//! its parent's budget, and so does a cgroup `mkdir` made in a directory
//! someone other than root may write. A
//! program that makes sub-jobs to refuse from -- anonymous ones, or named
//! ones in a cgroup delegated to it -- charges them all to the one budget,
//! so it writes at most [`PER_BUDGET_PER_SECOND`] refusals a second however
//! many jobs it makes, and cannot push another unit's refusals out faster
//! than that.
//!
//! # Numbering
//!
//! Each ring numbers its records from zero, per boot, without gaps, so a
//! reader who finds a number missing knows a record was lost, and is told
//! how many. A full ring overwrites its oldest record: refusing new ones
//! would let an attacker fill it first and then act unrecorded, and
//! stopping the TSF would make audit a lever for denial of service
//! (`AUDIT.md` §3).
//!
//! Each ring's lock is an [`IrqSpinLock`]: an IOMMU fault is recorded from
//! its interrupt handler, and an OOM kill can be decided with the
//! allocator's locks held, so a lock that left interrupts on could be taken
//! by a handler on the processor already holding it.
//!
//! **They are leaf locks.** Nothing is taken under them and nothing
//! allocates under them: a 64-byte copy and two counters. A limit's refusal
//! is recorded from inside the heap's charge path with other locks held, so
//! everything a record needs -- its subject among it -- is worked out
//! before a ring's lock is taken, and without a lock of its own on that
//! path ([`Subject::of`] is for callers that hold none).
//!
//! # The boot's own records
//!
//! The first [`BOOT_RECORDS`] system records -- the start-up record and the
//! boot's configuration -- are also pinned where no other record can reach
//! them ([`Which::Boot`]): the boot's own checks make processes, kill jobs
//! and set limits by the hundred, and could otherwise wrap the high-value
//! ring past them before any reader exists.
//!
//! # The boot's audit id
//!
//! A random 128-bit number drawn at start-up ([`start`]) and carried in the
//! start-up record and in every read, so that the records of two boots can
//! never be spliced into one sequence. The kernel's random generator is the
//! item's, above this module, so bring-up draws it and hands it in.
