//! The log core: the kernel log, read by a ring-3 driver over a control
//! channel.
//!
//! The kernel log (`console::log`) keeps every byte the console sends. On a
//! Pixel 7 booted natively the console is a record in RAM that Android reads
//! back after the run; the phone's USB serial port, driven from ring 3 by
//! `usbdev`, is how the boot's lines and `ferrix-statd`'s output reach the
//! host while it runs (`docs/vendor/google/pixel7/USB-HANDOVER.md`, phase 4). So the driver
//! asks for the log with `log_control_create` on its device, and this module
//! answers its READs with DATA from the log, `src/lib/proto/logctl`'s protocol.
//!
//! # Who may read
//!
//! The log holds every program's console output, which is the program's own,
//! so reading it is a capability, as `syslog(2)` makes it a privilege: a
//! driver holding `MANAGE` on a device whose binding carries the log off the
//! machine for its owner (`DeviceNode::reads_log`, only the Pixel 7's USB
//! device controller), and one at a time. The claim is this module's, not the
//! device's: there is one log, and two readers would each see half of it
//! only if they shared a cursor, which nothing asks for. It ends when the
//! channel closes, which the driver's process ending does, or when the driver
//! breaks the protocol.
//!
//! # Never woken by the console
//!
//! Recording a byte is all the console asks of the log, from any context, so
//! nothing here is woken when a line is printed. A task per claim serves the
//! channel and, while a READ is outstanding and the log has nothing new,
//! looks again every [`POLL_NANOS`]. The reader's cursor starts at the log's
//! beginning, so its first DATA is the oldest byte still kept, with what the
//! ring had already lost counted in it: a driver that starts late still gets
//! the boot.
