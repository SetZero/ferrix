//! The input subsystem: `inputctl`, spoken to the kernel's input core for any
//! driver that implements [`Device`] (`docs/INPUT.md` §3.2).
//!
//! The run, whatever the device:
//!
//! 1. START on the bootstrap channel; the driver binds and probes.
//! 2. HELLO, with a port the core holds, and the core's answer: READY starts
//!    the device, anything else ends the run.
//! 3. One port carries every event: the device's interrupt and the control
//!    channel becoming readable. Every interrupt hands the core whatever
//!    messages the device made.
//! 4. STOP, or the core closing its end, ends it: the device is reset, and
//!    STOPPED answers a STOP only if the reset finished.
//!
//! The exit status is the [`Step`] that failed, 0 a clean stop.
