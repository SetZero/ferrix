# pkg

Ferrix's package manager, `/bin/pkg` (`docs/APPS.md` §7). An app is built
into a package, a newc archive of its files and its record,
`lib/ferrix/packages/<name>.toml`; an image is packages installed into a
root. `pkg` does the same on a running Ferrix:

```
pkg [--root DIR] list               the packages installed
pkg [--root DIR] info NAME          one package: what it is and its files
pkg [--root DIR] install FILE...    install packages (.fxpkg), together
pkg [--root DIR] remove NAME        remove a package
```

There is no database: the records are what is installed. What a package is
-- the manifest, the record, the plan that orders a set and refuses a missing
dependency or a path owned twice -- is `src/lib/proto/pkg`, which xtask
builds images with, and the archive reader is the kernel's
`src/lib/fs/cpio`, so the image build and `pkg` agree on both.

`cargo test` here runs it against a directory as the root;
`cargo xtask test-pkg` boots it, installs, runs and removes the stat
service, and requires its three refusals.
