//! The socket (`docs/AUTH.md` §3.2): one `SOCK_SEQPACKET` listener, one
//! conversation per connection, and one `poll` for all of them.
//!
//! A conversation can stay open for hours, since the lock screen asks for
//! its first prompt when it locks, so connections are served side by side.
//! Hashing is not: a check runs to its end on this one thread, which is what
//! keeps `authd`'s memory to one hash's and makes a thousand connections
//! guess no faster than one (§3.5). A reply held for a failure's delay waits
//! in its connection's queue while the others are served.
