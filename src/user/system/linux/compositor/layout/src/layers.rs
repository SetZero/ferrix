//! Where a layer surface goes, and what it takes away from the windows.
//!
//! `zwlr_layer_shell_v1` gives a client four things to say -- which edges it
//! is anchored to, how big it wants to be, how far from those edges, and how
//! many pixels it reserves -- and the compositor works out a rectangle from
//! them. The rules are wlroots' `wlr_scene_layer_surface_v1_configure`, which
//! Hyprland and every other wlroots-shaped compositor follow:
//!
//! * The surface starts as the whole usable area, less its margins.
//! * An axis anchored to *both* edges keeps that width; anchored to one or
//!   to neither, it takes the size the client asked for and is put against
//!   the edge it is anchored to, or centred if it is anchored to neither.
//! * The exclusive zone is then taken off the usable area for whatever is
//!   configured after it, so two bars on the same edge stack rather than
//!   overlap.
//!
//! Order matters and it is the client's: surfaces are configured in the
//! order they were created, as wlroots does, so a bar that started first
//! gets the edge.
