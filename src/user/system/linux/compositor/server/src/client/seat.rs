//! `wl_seat`: the keyboard and the pointer, and what the pointer looks like.
//!
//! A seat is one person's input. A client binds it, is told which of a
//! keyboard, a pointer and a touchscreen it has, and asks for an object for
//! each. The requests are few -- `wl_pointer.set_cursor` and
//! `cursor-shape-v1`'s `set_shape` are all a client says about its input --
//! and the events are the rest: the keymap, the focus coming and going,
//! each key and button, each motion and each click of the wheel. The
//! compositor sends those through the methods here, to whichever client
//! has the focus.
//!
//! The pointer and keyboard protocols beyond these, from relative motion to
//! virtual keyboards, are in `input.rs`.
