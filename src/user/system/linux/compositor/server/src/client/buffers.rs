//! `wl_shm`: the memory a client draws into.
//!
//! A client makes a file, maps it, and hands the compositor its descriptor
//! as a `wl_shm_pool`. Each `wl_buffer` is a rectangle cut from that pool,
//! with a format and a stride. The compositor above maps the same file and
//! reads the pixels when a surface commits the buffer, so nothing is copied
//! across the socket.
//!
//! # The memory outlives the pool
//!
//! Destroying a pool does not take its memory away while buffers cut from
//! it live: the protocol says so, and `grim` relies on it. So a destroyed
//! pool is reported as retired rather than gone, and
//! [`Client::pool_in_use`] is what the compositor asks before it lets the
//! mapping go.
