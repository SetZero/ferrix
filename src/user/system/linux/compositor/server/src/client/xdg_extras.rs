//! Three `xdg` extensions that say more about a window than `xdg-shell`
//! does.
//!
//! * `xdg-decoration` -- who draws the title bar. The compositor, always:
//!   a tiling layout draws a border and no title, and a toolkit told
//!   `server_side` draws nothing of its own inside the rectangle it was
//!   given.
//! * `xdg-toplevel-icon` -- the icon a taskbar shows for a window, as a
//!   name in an icon theme or as pixels. The name is kept and the pixels
//!   are not, since nothing here draws them.
//! * `xdg-activation` -- a token one program hands another so that the
//!   second may take the focus. Only a token the compositor made is taken,
//!   and only once, which is what stops any program stealing the focus.
