//! The audit record's reader (`docs/certification/AUDIT.md` §4).
//!
//! The kernel gives pid 1 the one handle that reads the audit record, with
//! `READ` alone. Init keeps it here and, once `/` is settled, copies every
//! record into `/var/log/audit/<id>.bin` -- the boot's audit id in hex, so
//! two boots' records can never be mixed in one file -- 64 bytes each, as
//! `src/lib/proto/audit` lays them out. It asks once a second: the kernel
//! signals nothing, since a record is made where no port may be woken, and
//! whatever a ring overwrote between two reads shows in the file as a gap in
//! its numbers and is counted here. And it reads a last time just before it
//! asks for power-off, so that everything up to the power action itself is
//! on the volume.
//!
//! This is the interim the design allows until authentication gives
//! services uids of their own: then the reader becomes `audit.service`,
//! running as a user of its own, and init hands it the handle.
//!
//! The three rings are read in turn: the boot's own records first -- the
//! start-up record and the configuration, pinned where nothing overwrites
//! them -- then the high-value ring, passing over the numbers the boot
//! records already wrote, then the refusals.
