//! The virtio-blk driver process: a ring-3 program that serves one disk to
//! the kernel over the block ring.
//!
//! Everything that knows anything is a library. `ferrix-virtio-blk` drives
//! the device, `ferrix-blkring` speaks the ring, and `ferrix-blkserve` joins
//! the two; all three are tested on the host. `ferrix-driver` is the rest:
//! START, the virtio transport, pinned memory, and the ring's conversation
//! with the kernel (`docs/BLOCK-RING.md`). What is here is the one thing only
//! this driver knows: how the logic crate comes up on a virtio-blk device,
//! the geometry that makes, and how it goes down.
//!
//! The exit status is a `ferrix_driver::Step`, 0 a clean STOP, and from 20 up
//! the fault that stopped the serve loop (`ferrix_driver::block::fault_status`).
