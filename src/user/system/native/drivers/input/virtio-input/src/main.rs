//! The virtio-input driver process: a ring-3 program that serves one input
//! device to the kernel's input core.
//!
//! Everything that knows anything is a library. `ferrix-virtio-input` drives
//! the device and turns its events into the messages the core reads, and
//! `ferrix-driver` is the rest: START, the virtio transport, pinned memory,
//! and `inputctl` with the core (`docs/INPUT.md` §3.2). What is here is the
//! one thing only this driver knows: how the logic crate comes up on a
//! virtio-input device, and how its answers map to the input subsystem's.
//!
//! The exit status is the `ferrix_driver::Step` that failed, 0 a clean STOP.
