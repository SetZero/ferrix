//! adb over USB: the adb interface's two bulk endpoints bridged to a Unix
//! socket that `adbd` connects to (`docs/ADB.md` §4, step 3).
//!
//! The shape is `vport`'s: the driver moves bytes and understands as little
//! of them as it can, and the Linux program on the other side of the socket
//! speaks the protocol. Two things adb over USB needs that a byte stream
//! does not:
//!
//! * **A transfer per part.** The host reads a message's 24-byte header with
//!   one bulk read and its payload with another, as AOSP's adbd sends them,
//!   so each goes out as a transfer of its own: a transfer that ran on into
//!   the payload would overrun the host's header read. So the bridge reads
//!   the header's length word and hands the controller one part at a time,
//!   the next only once the last has gone.
//! * **A payload that fits one transfer.** adbd over USB offers at most
//!   [`MAX_PAYLOAD`] bytes, the endpoint's ring, so a whole payload is one
//!   transfer.
//!
//! A stream that stops parsing as adb, a USB reset or a disconnect drops the
//! client: adbd connects again and starts clean, and the host sends a new
//! `CNXN` when it comes back.
