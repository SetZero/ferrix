//! What is behind the windows, kept on the GPU, and the blur of it.
//!
//! [`crate::Backdrop`]'s job and its shape: a sharp copy of everything
//! behind the windows, brought up to date inside each frame's damage, and
//! the blur of it in tiles, a tile blurred again only after what it was
//! blurred from has changed. Two things differ from the software one, and
//! both because of where the pixels are.
//!
//! It cannot *look*. The software backdrop compares what it is given with
//! what it holds, so a pointer crossing the wallpaper -- which damages it
//! and changes nothing -- blurs nothing. Pixels on a GPU cannot be compared
//! without fetching them, which costs more than the blur. So a tile is stale
//! when the damage reached it, changed or not. A GPU's blur of a few tiles
//! is a fraction of a millisecond, which is what makes that the right trade.
//!
//! And its textures are made by the canvas that first keeps it, since a
//! backdrop has no device of its own.
