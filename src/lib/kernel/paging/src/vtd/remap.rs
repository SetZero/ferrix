//! VT-d interrupt remapping: the interrupt remapping table's entries, the
//! remappable-format messages and I/O APIC entries that name them, the
//! fault-recording register's reason, and the rule for when a machine's
//! interrupts are isolated.
//!
//! Reference: Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O, Architecture
//! Specification, "Interrupt Remapping" (5.1) and the fault reasons of
//! 7.1; checked against QEMU's `hw/i386/intel_iommu.c` (`vtd_irte_get`,
//! `vtd_interrupt_remap_msi`) and `hw/intc/ioapic.c`, which the boot tests
//! run.
//!
//! # An entry is written while not present, and never edited
//!
//! The kernel writes an entry's high quadword (the source-ID check) first
//! and its low quadword, with `P`, last, while the entry is not present,
//! and invalidates it in the unit's interrupt entry cache before the
//! message that names it is programmed. Vectors are minted once and kept
//! for the life of the machine, so an entry is never retargeted or freed.
//! **Any later change to a present entry must clear it first** -- mask the
//! device, clear `P`, invalidate and wait, then rewrite as above -- or write
//! it whole with a 128-bit `cmpxchg16b`; never two plain stores to a
//! present entry.
//!
//! # Posted interrupts are never used
//!
//! `IM` is always 0: an entry remaps, it never posts, whatever the unit's
//! posted-interrupt capability says.

/// One interrupt remapping table entry: its low quadword, then its high
/// one, as the unit reads them.
