//! VT-d queued invalidation: the 128-bit descriptors a remapping unit's
//! invalidation queue holds, and the queue's registers' encodings.
//!
//! Reference: Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O, Architecture
//! Specification, "Queued Invalidation Interface" and its descriptor layouts;
//! checked against QEMU's `hw/i386/intel_iommu.c` and
//! `intel_iommu_internal.h`, whose reserved-bit masks a descriptor here must
//! pass (`VTD_INV_DESC_*_RSVD*`), or the unit stops its queue with `IQE`.
//!
//! The kernel uses the legacy 128-bit descriptors (`IQA.DW` = 0) in one
//! 4 KiB queue (`IQA.QS` = 0): 256 of them. Every invalidation the kernel
//! makes is one descriptor and a wait descriptor behind it, so the queue is
//! never more than a few deep.

/// One descriptor: its low quadword, then its high one, as the unit reads
/// them from the queue.
