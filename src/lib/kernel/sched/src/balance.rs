//! Four things live here, and all four are arithmetic over numbers the kernel

//!   what every decision below is made against. A queue's length is the
//!   obvious alternative and the wrong one: four tasks that sleep most of the
//!   time are not the load that one spinner is.
//! * [`place`], which picks the processor a waking or new task should go to.
//! * [`imbalance`] and [`busiest`], which say whether it is worth moving a
//!   task that is already somewhere, and from where.
//! * [`slice_for`], which shares a target latency out among however many
