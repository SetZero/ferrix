//! The hand-over of a GPU to `nvrm`, as `devmgr`'s `Gpu` kind makes it
//! (`docs/NVIDIA.md` §4.1, §12.2 and §12.3; NVIDIA's N1b).
//!
//! A GPU runs firmware of its own -- NVIDIA's GSP -- which is not the
//! driver's to vouch for, and its driver pins far more than any other. So
//! before `nvrm` is started on one, three things must hold, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **The mark** ([`crate::isolation`]): the device's isolated-interrupts
//!    mark is set, set-once, so the kernel refuses the device vectors and
//!    pins whenever the machine's interrupts are not isolated. A mark the
//!    kernel refuses stops the launch. It comes first so that the kernel's
//!    own guard is armed whatever `devmgr` decides next.
//! 2. **Isolation**: `device_isolation` says the machine's interrupts are
//!    isolated and this device's messages are remapped (bit 1). Without it
//!    the GPU is not handed over at all: the kernel would refuse `nvrm` its
//!    vectors and pins anyway, and a driver started only to be refused is a
//!    launch that hides why. This is where F-57's closure is checked for the
//!    `ferrix-3060` domain at N1's first boot.
//! 3. **The budget** ([`crate::budget`]): the pin budget is planned from
//!    the kernel's ceiling and room and set with `device_set_limit`, before
//!    the driver starts, since the kernel refuses a change under live pins.
//!    A budget too small, or one the kernel refuses, stops the launch; there
//!    is no fallback to the default.
//!
//! Every outcome is one named line. A pure function of what the kernel
//! answers, tested on the host; `devmgr` supplies the calls.
