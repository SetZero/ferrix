//! What the kernel says to pid 1 before pid 1 runs (`docs/INIT.md` §6, K2).
//!
//! The kernel starts init with a bootstrap channel, as it starts `devmgr`,
//! and writes one message on its own end first. Init takes its end with
//! `process_bootstrap` ([`crate::nr::PROCESS_BOOTSTRAP`]) and reads the
//! message with `channel_read`. The kernel keeps its end open for as long as
//! the program runs, so later versions can carry what version 1 does not:
//! a power handle, and in a microkernel the device root and physical memory.
//!
//! # The header, which never changes
//!
//! Eight bytes: the magic `FXIN`, then the version as a little-endian `u32`.
//! Little-endian on every target rather than native, so the bytes are the
//! same on all three and a reader needs no word of the kernel's to parse
//! them. What follows the header, and which handles the message carries, is
//! the version's to say.
//!
//! # Version 1
//!
//! The header alone: [`INIT_HELLO_BYTES`] bytes and no handles. A reader
//! that knows version 1 accepts any version from 1 up and reads the header
//! only, since a later version adds after it and never changes it.
//!
//! # After the hello: devmgr's starter, and where `/` is
//!
//! Under `ferrix.devmgr=init` (`docs/INIT.md` §7.3, L12) two more messages
//! follow on the same channel, each eight bytes in the header's shape, a
//! magic and a little-endian `u32`:
//!
//! * [`DEVMGR_STARTER_MAGIC`], written straight after the hello, carries one
//!   handle: the one-shot capability `devmgr_start` takes
//!   ([`crate::nr::NativeCall::DevmgrStart`]), with `MANAGE` and nothing
//!   else, so it can never leave pid 1's table. Its `u32` is 1.
//! * [`ROOT_MAGIC`], written once the kernel has decided where `/` is, when
//!   the root disk's driver has published it or it is known there is none.
//!   Its `u32` is [`ROOT_SWITCHED`] when `/` is now the root volume and pid 1
//!   has been moved onto it, and [`ROOT_IN_MEMORY`] when `/` stays the
//!   tmpfs. No handles.
//!
//! A boot without the option writes neither.
//!
//! # The audit record's reader
//!
//! [`AUDIT_MAGIC`], written after the hello on every boot, carries one
//! handle: the audit record's (`docs/certification/AUDIT.md` §4), with
//! `READ` and nothing else, so it can never leave pid 1's table. Its `u32`
//! is 1. Only the first program is given it.
