//! Stage 7's threads exit test: a static musl Rust program that uses
//! `std::thread`, `Mutex` and `mpsc` the way `rustc` does, run as init by
//! `cargo xtask test-threads` on all three architectures.
//!
//! Every step prints a line and then `<step> ok`, and the program ends with
//! `threads: all ok` and status 0, or `threads: FAILED <what>` and status 1.
//! Built with the `negative-control` feature it expects one thread more under
//! `/proc/self` than it has, and must fail on exactly that step.
//!
//! The steps:
//!
//! * **spawn**: four named threads, which each wait at a barrier before they
//!   do anything, so that all five are alive for the next step;
//! * **proc**: `/proc/self/status` counts five threads, `/proc/self/task`
//!   lists five, and each one's `status` names this process in `Tgid`;
//! * **channel**: once let past the barrier, each thread sends its index;
//! * **join**: each thread's value comes back through `join`;
//! * **mutex**: four threads' thousand increments each, under one `Mutex`,
//!   are all there;
//! * **copy**: after a fork has made this process's memory copy-on-write,
//!   and while four threads keep the other processors busy in this address
//!   space, the main one writes to sixty-four pages, each of which the
//!   kernel has to make writable again and take back from every processor
//!   that may have the old translation cached. A page fault that waits for
//!   other processors with interrupts masked stops the machine here, which
//!   is how a compositor drawing on several threads found it.
