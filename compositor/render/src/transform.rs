//! A turned monitor: the frame, drawn upright, put on the screen turned.
//!
//! `monitor = ..., transform, N` says how the monitor stands. Everything
//! above the renderer -- the layout, the decorations, the layer surfaces,
//! the pointer -- works in the monitor as a person reads it, which for a
//! monitor stood on its edge is taller than it is wide. The connector does
//! not know it has been turned and scans out a buffer of its own mode. So
//! somewhere between the two the picture has to be turned, and this is
//! where.
//!
//! # Where Hyprland turns it, and where this does
//!
//! Hyprland draws on a GPU and folds the turn into its projection:
//! `CMonitor::updateMatrix` puts the monitor's transform into
//! `m_projMatrix`, every box drawn is projected through it, and the frame
//! lands in the buffer already turned. Nothing is drawn twice and nothing
//! is copied.
//!
//! A CPU renderer has no projection to fold it into. Drawing every
//! rectangle, border and client buffer turned would mean giving up what
//! makes the software path fast -- rows copied whole, a blur that walks
//! rows, a backdrop kept upright from frame to frame -- for a monitor most
//! people never turn. So the frame is drawn exactly as on an upright
//! monitor, on a [`Canvas`] the size of the monitor as it is read, and the
//! turn happens once, on the way out: [`Canvas::present_transformed`]
//! writes each damaged pixel to the place the transform sends it in the
//! screen's buffer, and hands back the damage in the buffer's own pixels
//! for the card and the night-light. An upright monitor never comes here;
//! its frame is copied by [`Canvas::present`], row by row, exactly as it
//! was before this existed.
//!
//! The price is that a turned monitor's pixels are moved one at a time
//! rather than a row at a time, and only the damaged ones; nothing else of
//! the frame costs more.
//!
//! # The direction
//!
//! Each pixel goes where Hyprland's matrix sends it. `CMonitor::updateMatrix`
//! (`src/output/Monitor.cpp`) builds
//!
//! ```text
//! m_projMatrix = translate(m_pixelSize / 2) * transform(m_transform) * translate(-m_transformedSize / 2)
//! ```
//!
//! with hyprutils' `Mat3x3::transform` table, which is wlroots'. For
//! transform 1 that table's matrix sends `(x, y)` to `(y, -x)`, so a point
//! of a `W` x `H` logical frame goes to `(y - H/2, W/2 - x)` about the
//! centre and to `(y, W - x)` in a buffer `H` wide and `W` tall: the frame's
//! top left is the buffer's bottom left. Hyprland reaches the same place by
//! a second road for the damage and the scissor --
//! `CBox::transform(invertTransform(m_transform), ...)` -- and wlroots by a
//! third, `wlr_box_transform` with `wlr_output_transform_invert`; all three
//! agree, and so does [`point`], in whole pixels (`W - 1 - x`).
//!
//! In words: the buffer holds the picture turned the way the protocol names
//! -- transform 1 is "90 degrees counter-clockwise" -- with the flipped four
//! mirrored left to right before they are turned. To read a picture the
//! connector scans out turned counter-clockwise, a person turns the monitor
//! clockwise, onto its right-hand edge: that is transform 1, and a monitor
//! turned the other way, onto its left-hand edge, is transform 3.
