//! What is behind the windows, kept from frame to frame, and the blur of it.
//!
//! Hyprland's `decoration:blur:new_optimizations`, which is on by default. A
//! tiled window does not blur the frame as it stands when the window is
//! drawn: the monitor keeps a framebuffer of its own, `m_blurFB`, holding the
//! background and the layer surfaces under the windows *already blurred*,
//! blurs it again only when one of those changes (`m_blurFBDirty`,
//! `CHyprOpenGLImpl::preRender` in `src/render/OpenGL.cpp`), and a window
//! samples it. `IHyprRenderer::shouldUseNewBlurOptimizations` in
//! `src/render/Renderer.cpp` says which windows do; [`crate::reads_backdrop`]
//! is that rule here.
//!
//! On a GPU that saves a few passes. Here it is the difference between a
//! desktop that can be used and one that cannot: a software blur behind a
//! full-screen window is most of a tenth of a second, and without this every
//! frame that touched a translucent window paid it -- one for each pointer
//! motion over a terminal, one for each letter typed into it.
//!
//! So a [`Backdrop`] holds two canvases. `sharp` is what is behind the
//! windows, brought up to date within each frame's damage. `blurred` is the
//! blur of it, in tiles: a tile is blurred the first time a window needs it
//! and again only after the pixels it was blurred *from* have changed. Which
//! they have is found by looking -- [`Backdrop::take`] compares what it is
//! given with what it holds -- because a frame's damage says what was drawn
//! again, not what came out different, and a pointer crossing a window
//! damages the wallpaper under it without changing one pixel of it.
//!
//! The blur of a tile is the same pixels a blur of the whole window would
//! have put there: [`Canvas::blur_from`] snaps what it reads to the lattice
//! the pyramid halves on, and a tile's edges are on it.
