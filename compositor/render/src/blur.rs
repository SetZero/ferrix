//! Dual-Kawase blur, on the CPU, with the colour grading Hyprland grades it
//! with.
//!
//! Hyprland blurs what is *behind* a translucent window: the frame so far is
//! taken, blurred, and written back under the window before the window is
//! drawn over it. The blur itself is four shaders, run in this order over
//! the frame:
//!
//! 1. `blurprepare.glsl` once, over the whole region: `blur:contrast`
//!    through the `gain` curve, then `blur:brightness` where it brightens.
//! 2. `blur1.glsl`'s five-tap downsample, `decoration:blur:passes` times,
//!    each pass halving the size and each ending in the `blur:vibrancy`
//!    saturation boost.
//! 3. `blur2.glsl`'s eight-tap upsample, the same number of times back up.
//! 4. `blurFinish.glsl` once: a hash dither at `blur:noise`, then
//!    `blur:brightness` where it darkens.
//!
//! The two kernels are, exactly:
//!
//! ```text
//! down(uv) = (4·t(2uv) + t(2uv − h·r) + t(2uv + h·r)
//!             + t(2uv + (hx, −hy)·r) + t(2uv − (hx, −hy)·r)) / 8
//!
//! up(uv)   = ( t(uv/2 + (−2hx, 0)·r) + 2·t(uv/2 + (−hx,  hy)·r)
//!            + t(uv/2 + (0,  2hy)·r) + 2·t(uv/2 + ( hx,  hy)·r)
//!            + t(uv/2 + ( 2hx, 0)·r) + 2·t(uv/2 + ( hx, −hy)·r)
//!            + t(uv/2 + (0, −2hy)·r) + 2·t(uv/2 + (−hx, −hy)·r) ) / 12
//! ```
//!
//! with `h` the half-pixel of the buffer being written and `r` the radius.
//! Sampling is bilinear with the edges clamped, which is what
//! `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE` and `GL_LINEAR` give the shader.
//!
//! # The grading is not decoration
//!
//! Hyprland's defaults grade every blur -- `contrast` is 0.8916 and
//! `vibrancy` 0.1696 out of the box -- so a blur drawn without them is not a
//! plainer blur, it is the wrong colour. The five values are in [`Blur`],
//! each with Hyprland's own default, and each applied at the point in the
//! chain its shader applies it: `contrast` before the first downsample and
//! `noise` after the last upsample are different pictures from doing either
//! in the middle.
//!
//! The noise is a hash of the pixel's position on the monitor, not a random
//! number: `blurFinish.glsl`'s `hash(v_texcoord)`, fed the same coordinate
//! the shader is fed. Two frames of the same scene are therefore the same
//! bytes, which is what lets an expected image hold it.
//!
//! # What it costs
//!
//! Each pass halves the size, so the whole chain touches at most twice the
//! source's pixels going down and twice going up: about `4 × w × h` samples
//! of five and eight taps. The eight-tap upsample at full resolution is
//! three quarters of them -- 16 million of a screen's 25 million at three
//! passes -- and that is where a blurred frame's time goes.
//!
//! A full screen at 1920x1080, `size = 8`, `passes = 3`: **85 ms**, from
//! 304 ms when the pyramid was first written.
//! `a_full_screen_blur_is_inside_the_stated_bound` holds the number. What
//! bought it, none of it changing a single byte of any expected image:
//!
//! * The bilinear sample's rows, its vertical weight and its clamps come
//!   out of the pixel loop and are worked out once an output row a tap
//!   ([`Plane::blend_row`]), so a tap is one mix across rather than three.
//! * `f32::floor` is a call out to the C library on a baseline x86-64,
//!   where the instruction that would do it in one go is an extension the
//!   target does not assume. A truncating cast and a step back for the
//!   negatives is the same answer in one instruction, and was a fifth of
//!   the whole blur ([`floor`]).
//! * `blurprepare.glsl`'s contrast curve is a power of each channel, and it
//!   runs over the block before anything else has touched it, so every
//!   channel is still one of a byte's 256 values: a table of 256 rather
//!   than six million calls to `powf` ([`prepared`]).
//!
//! What is left is the tap itself, and a software dual-Kawase cannot go
//! much under 16 million of them for a screen. Past this the levers are a
//! renderer that spreads its rows over cores, explicit vector arithmetic,
//! or the GPU -- each a decision about what this compositor is, rather than
//! an arithmetic one, and none of them taken here.
