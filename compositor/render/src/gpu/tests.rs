//! The GPU's frame against the software one.
//!
//! The same [`render_onto`], the same layout, styles and pixels, drawn once
//! by [`crate::Canvas`] and once by [`Canvas`] on virglrenderer's test
//! server -- the renderer a guest's frames reach through QEMU, run on this
//! host's GL. The software frame is the reference, byte-exact against its
//! own expected images elsewhere in this crate; what is asked here is that
//! the GPU's is the same picture.
//!
//! "The same" is not byte for byte, and the module's own comment says why.
//! So a frame is judged by how many of its pixels are further than a small
//! step from the reference's, and how far the furthest is: a shape cut a
//! pixel differently at a corner is a handful of pixels, and a wrong colour,
//! a missing decoration or a flipped texture is thousands.
//!
//! A host with no `virgl_test_server` runs none of this, and says so.
