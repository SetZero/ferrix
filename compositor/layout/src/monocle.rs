//! The monocle layout: Hyprland's `MonocleAlgorithm.cpp`.
//!
//! Every window fills the workspace, and one of them is shown. The others
//! are behind it, the same size, and are not drawn at all -- Hyprland sets
//! their layout alpha to zero and blocks their input, and this leaves them
//! out of the frame, which comes to the same picture.
//!
//! What makes it a layout rather than a fullscreen window: the windows are
//! still tiled, so `cyclenext` walks them, closing one shows the next, and
//! nothing about the workspace's gaps, border or rounding changes. A person
//! who wants one window at a time on a small screen writes
//! `general:layout = monocle` and gets a tabbed workspace with no tabs.
//!
//! # Which one is shown
//!
//! The focused one. Hyprland hooks the focus event and brings the focused
//! window to the front (`focusTargetUpdate`), so a window focused by a
//! click, by `cyclenext`, or by a `windowrule` is the one on top. This
//! keeps the same rule by asking who is focused when the slots are worked
//! out, rather than by holding an index -- the focus is already the
//! compositor's and an index beside it is a second answer to the same
//! question.
//!
//! A new window is shown at once, which is what `newTarget` does by
//! pointing the index at it: here that falls out of the compositor
//! focusing a window that has just opened.
