//! `hyprland.conf`, parsed into the compositor's configuration.
//!
//! Hyprland's configuration language is hyprlang: one `key = value` per line,
//! `#` comments with `##` for a literal `#`, `category { … }` blocks that may
//! nest and the `category:key = value` shorthand for them, `$variables`
//! expanded in values, keywords such as `bind`, `windowrule` and `exec-once`
//! that add to a list rather than set an option, and `source` to read
//! another file in place.
//!
//! As Hyprland does, a line that fails does not stop the file: it becomes a
//! [`Diagnostic`] carrying Hyprland's wording, and every other line applies.
//! [`parse`] therefore never fails; it returns the configuration and the
//! diagnostics side by side.
//!
//! Nothing here touches a file system except [`FsSources`], so the parser is
//! a pure function of the text and of what `source` resolves to, which the
//! tests and the fuzz target give it from memory.
//!
//! What is not handled yet, each reported as a diagnostic rather than
//! misread: hyprlang's `# hyprlang` directives, `{{ }}` expressions, globs in
//! `source`, and keyed categories such as `device[name] { … }`.
