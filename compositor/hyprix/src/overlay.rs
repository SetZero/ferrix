//! `debug:overlay`: the frames-per-second counter Hyprland draws over the
//! top left corner of the first monitor.
//!
//! A port of Hyprland 0.56.2's `src/debug/Overlay.cpp`, which is what a
//! person turns on with `debug { overlay = true }` or `hyprctl keyword
//! debug:overlay 1` to see how fast the compositor is drawing. For every
//! monitor that has drawn a frame it shows, in one blurred, rounded box:
//!
//! * the monitor's name;
//! * its frames per second over the last second's worth of frames, green
//!   above 95% of the refresh rate, yellow above 80% and red below;
//! * a graph of the last thirty seconds, one bar a second, each as tall and
//!   as green as that second came near the refresh rate;
//! * the average time between frames, and the time drawing one took with
//!   and without the overlay, each with how far apart the shortest and the
//!   longest were;
//! * the average time between animation ticks, and so ticks per second.
//!
//! and under the box, the warning Hyprland gives: a compositor that draws
//! only when something changes draws few frames over a still desktop, and
//! the counter says so rather than letting a person think it slow.
//!
//! The numbers are rewritten every 200 ms and a frame is asked for that
//! often, as Hyprland's `COverlay::draw` does, so the counter moves over a
//! desktop where nothing else does.
//!
//! What differs is the text. Hyprland lays its lines out with Pango in
//! `misc:font_family`; this compositor has no font renderer, and draws them
//! in Spleen 8x16, the bitmap face the kernel's panic screen uses
//! (`libs/fbtext`), at twice its size for the frames-per-second line as
//! Hyprland draws that line at 16 points against the others' 10. The
//! layout -- margins, gaps, the graph's bars, the colours -- is Hyprland's
//! own numbers.
