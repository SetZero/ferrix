//! The pointer on a cursor plane of its own.
//!
//! Drawn into the frame, the pointer costs a frame every time it moves: the
//! damage round the old place and the new, a flush to the host, and -- on a
//! screen served over VNC -- an update the viewer gets only when the server
//! next looks, which is every 30 ms. A card with a cursor plane shows a small
//! image over the frame and moves it for the asking. virtio-gpu has one: the
//! image goes to the host once, and every move after that is a command on
//! the cursor queue that nobody waits for. A host that serves the screen
//! over VNC hands the image to the viewer, which draws it where its own
//! mouse is, and the pointer a person watching sees has no lag at all
//! (`docs/GPU.md` §3.9).
//!
//! So a screen whose backend has a plane shows the pointer on it, and its
//! frames neither draw the pointer nor count its moves as damage. What does
//! not fit -- a client's cursor larger than the plane -- is drawn into the
//! frame as before, and so is everything on a screen with no plane.
//! Hyprland's `cursor:no_hardware_cursors = 1` asks for that everywhere.
//!
//! A turned monitor (`monitor = ..., transform, N`) has its frame drawn
//! upright and turned on the way into the buffer the card scans out
//! (`compositor_render::transform`); the card knows nothing of the turn.
//! So the plane is told in the buffer's terms, as the frame is: the image
//! turned the same way, its hotspot with it, and its place where the
//! transform sends the pointer ([`turned`]). The DK1's monitor stands on
//! its edge, and its frames are the slowest there are.
