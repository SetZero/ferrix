//! The input devices, and what their events mean.
//!
//! `compositor/evecho` opens a `/dev/input/eventN` and reads whole
//! `input_event`s. This turns those into the [`Input`]s the seat understands:
//! evdev's relative axes into pixels, its absolute axes into a fraction of
//! the device's own range, and its keys and buttons apart.
//!
//! # One move for many reports
//!
//! A device reports x and y as two events, and a mouse sends hundreds of
//! reports a second, all queued between two of the compositor's reads. The
//! pointer's moves are therefore gathered: a read's axis events become one
//! move to where the device last said it was, sent before anything that is
//! not a move -- a button, a key, a wheel click -- and at the end of the read.
//! Sent one per axis event, a client was told first the new x with the old
//! y and then the new y, a staircase instead of the hand's line, and twice
//! per report: Chrome, drawing in software, fell tens of seconds behind a
//! drag and put its selection somewhere the pointer had never been.
//!
//! # Why absolute axes are a fraction
//!
//! A tablet reports where it is in its own units -- QEMU's virtio-tablet in
//! 0 to 32767 -- and only the device knows what its range is, through
//! `EVIOCGABS`. The seat knows how big the screen is. So the conversion is
//! here, where the range is, and the seat multiplies by the screen: a device
//! with another range then needs no change anywhere else.
//!
//! # What is left out
//!
//! Touch is not forwarded: `wl_touch` would need the whole multi-touch
//! protocol, and the seat announces no touch capability, so a client would
//! never be given an object to send it on. `EV_MSC` scan codes, `EV_SW`
//! switches and `EV_LED` are dropped, which is what libinput does with them
//! for a Wayland seat.
