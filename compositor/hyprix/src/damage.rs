//! What a frame has to redraw, and nothing else.
//!
//! Hyprland keeps a damage region for each monitor and adds to it as things
//! happen: `IHyprRenderer::damageSurface` for the pixels a client says it
//! drew, `damageWindow` for a window that moved -- the whole of its
//! bounding box, where it was and where it is -- and `damageMonitor` for
//! everything else (`src/render/Renderer.cpp`). This is the same region,
//! gathered in two halves that between them cover every pixel a frame can
//! change.
//!
//! The first half is what is *inside* a surface, which only its client can
//! change and only by committing: `wl_surface.damage` and `damage_buffer`
//! say which part, and those arrive here as [`Painted`] while the
//! connections are read.
//!
//! The second half is everything the compositor itself decides: where each
//! window is, which one has the focus, what a `windowrule` gave it, where
//! the bars and the menus are, where the pointer is, whether the session is
//! locked. There are some forty places in the loop that change one of
//! those, and a damage region built by instrumenting each of them is one
//! stale pixel away from a bug nobody can explain. So the *whole
//! description* a frame is drawn from is kept as a [`Plan`] and compared
//! with the last frame's, and what differs is damaged in both places --
//! which is what `damageWindow` does for a window that moved.
//!
//! Anything neither half can place damages the whole screen: a needless
//! redraw is only slow, and [`Told::everything`] is this module's
//! `damageMonitor`.
//!
//! # The blur reads more than it writes
//!
//! Then the region is grown once more, for the one thing a frame draws that
//! reads further than it writes: the blur behind a translucent surface.
//! There are two kinds ([`Blurred::live`]) and each is owed something else.
//!
//! A tiled window takes its blur from `compositor_render::Backdrop`, which
//! keeps what is behind the windows and the blur of it from frame to frame.
//! Nothing is drawn over that, so a strip of such a window can be redrawn
//! alone -- which is what makes a pointer crossing a translucent terminal,
//! or a letter typed into one, cost what it changes and not a blur of the
//! whole window. It is owed more only where what is *behind* the windows
//! changed, because a changed pixel shows in the blur a kernel's reach
//! away: [`Plan::behind_reaches`].
//!
//! Everything else blurs the frame as it stands, and is owed a whole
//! redraw whenever the damage touches it: [`Plan::blurs_whole`] says why
//! there is no cheaper way to be exact about that.
//!
//! # Two buffers, two frames
//!
//! The canvas keeps the whole picture from frame to frame -- that is what
//! makes redrawing a strip of it legal -- but the screen may not. The card
//! backend draws into two buffers in turn, so the one being drawn into
//! holds the frame from *two* frames ago, and copying only this frame's
//! damage into it would leave the frame before's changes off the screen.
//! [`Frame::screen`] is therefore this frame's damage and the last one's,
//! which is Hyprland's damage ring at a buffer age of two
//! (`CMonitor::addDamage`).
//!
//! A screen with one buffer is owed only this frame's: `Backend::age` says
//! which a screen is, and a virtio-gpu, which is sent what changed rather
//! than flipped to, is the one that has one.
