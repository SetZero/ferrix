//! The Wayland socket: where a client connects and how descriptors travel.
//!
//! Everything above this crate is bytes and object ids. This is the part that
//! has to be on Ferrix to be tried: an `AF_UNIX` stream socket, `sendmsg` and
//! `recvmsg` with `SCM_RIGHTS`, and the rules about where the socket file
//! goes.
//!
//! # Why not `std::os::unix::net` alone
//!
//! `UnixStream` carries bytes and nothing else. Wayland's `wl_shm.create_pool`
//! and `wl_keyboard.keymap` send descriptors beside the bytes, in a
//! `SCM_RIGHTS` control message, and the standard library's support for those
//! is unstable. So the listening and the accepting are `std`'s, and the two
//! calls that carry a control message are `libc`'s.
//!
//! # A read is a whole number of bytes, not a whole number of messages
//!
//! A stream socket may deliver half a message, and the descriptors that came
//! with a message may arrive before the bytes that name them. [`Connection`]
//! keeps both: the bytes that have not been made into whole messages, and the
//! descriptors that have not been claimed. The server above takes as many
//! whole messages as it can and says how many bytes that was.
