//! * Pid 1's own bootstrap channel ([`Directory::open`]): taken with
//!   `process_bootstrap`, and the kernel's hello read from it (K2). Init
//!   keeps it; later versions carry handles over it.
//! * One port, as a descriptor in init's epoll (`port_fd`, K4): every
//!   service channel and every native process is watched through it.
//! * A bootstrap channel for each service that declares `Uses=` or
//!   `Offers=`, and for every `Type=native` one. A Linux service is given its
//!   end with `process_give` (K3) while it waits, before `execve`, on a pipe
//!   init writes once the give is done (§5.2 step 3); a native one gets it
//!   from `process_start`.
//! * `Type=native` services, made with `process_create` in the job behind
//!   their cgroup (`job_for_cgroup`, C8) from the ELF file `ExecStart=`
//!   names, and watched for `TERMINATED`; how one ended is read with
//!   `process_status` (K6).
//! * The directory's messages on those channels ([`directory`]): READY
//!   is readiness, OFFER a provider's channel for a name, OPEN a client's
//!   request, which the manager routes ([`Action::Route`]) or refuses
//!   ([`Action::Refuse`]); init forwards the client's end as CONNECT, or
