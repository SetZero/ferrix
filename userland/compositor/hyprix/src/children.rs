//! Reaping the programs the compositor starts, and, as pid 1, every orphan.
//!
//! [`crate::state::start`] starts an `exec-once` program and does not wait
//! for it, so one that ended stayed a zombie for as long as the compositor
//! ran: a killed Chrome among them. And while the images boot the compositor
//! as pid 1 -- until init takes that place (`docs/INIT.md`, L10) -- the
//! kernel hands it every orphan too, and a pipeline's earlier stages piled up
//! under `PPid: 1`.
//!
//! `SIGCHLD` writes a byte to a pipe the event loop polls, so the loop wakes
//! when a child ends, whichever of the compositor's threads took the signal.
//! Each pass then reaps the programs it started, by pid. Only as pid 1 does it
//! reap by `-1`: otherwise the vtest renderer waits for its own
//! `virgl_test_server`, and would find it gone.
