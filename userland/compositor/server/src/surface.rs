//! Surfaces and regions: what a client draws on, and what it says about it.
//!
//! # Nothing takes effect until a commit
//!
//! Every `wl_surface` request but `destroy` and `frame` changes *pending*
//! state; `commit` makes the pending state current, all of it at once. That
//! is the whole reason a window never tears or shows half an update: a client
//! attaches a new buffer, says which part changed, sets its scale and commits,
//! and the compositor sees one consistent surface rather than four halfway
//! ones.
//!
//! What the protocol calls double-buffered is spelled out here as two structs
//! with the same shape, because the alternative -- flags saying which fields
//! are dirty -- is where the bugs are.
//!
//! # A commit's damage is not its buffer's damage
//!
//! `wl_surface.damage` is in surface coordinates and `damage_buffer` in the
//! buffer's, which differ when the scale or transform is not the identity.
//! Both accumulate until a commit and both are cleared by it, as
//! `wl_surface`'s description says. They are kept apart here and joined only
//! when the frame is drawn, which is where the scale that applies to them is
//! known.
