//! A compositor with a mouse and no arrow on the screen is one a person
//! cannot use, and the arrow has to come from somewhere. Hyprland loads an
//! `XCursor` or a `hyprcursor` theme; Ferrix has no theme files and no
//! library to read them with, so the one this draws when no client has said
//! otherwise is here, in code, as a shape rather than as a file.
//!
//! It is the shape every desktop's default cursor is: a left-pointing arrow
//! with a black outline and a white fill, its tip at the pointer. A client
//! that calls `wl_pointer.set_cursor` replaces it with its own surface,
//! which is how a text field shows an I-beam and a link shows a hand.
