//! The free-running counter on x86-64.
//!
//! Two candidates, in order of preference.
//!
//! The **HPET** is a counter in the chipset with a period firmware states
//! exactly, in femtoseconds, in a table. Nothing has to be calibrated: the
//! frequency is read, not measured, which means it carries no error at all.
//!
//! The **TSC** is a counter in the CPU. It is faster to read and it is what a
//! grown kernel ends up using, but nothing tells you its frequency — it has to
//! be measured against something else, and the only clock guaranteed to exist
//! for that is the PIT, a part designed in 1981. So the TSC is the fallback,
//! for a machine with no HPET table.
//!
//! Either way the answer is a counter and a frequency, and the rest of the
//! kernel is told neither which one it got nor that there was a choice.
