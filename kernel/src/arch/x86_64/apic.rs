//! The local APIC and the I/O APIC.
//!
//! The local APIC is per-CPU and is how a timer interrupt and, from stage 4,
//! an inter-processor interrupt reach this core. The I/O APIC is per-machine
//! and is how a *device* interrupt does. Stage 3 needs the first and only
//! quiesces the second: nothing is wired to a device line until stage 10, and
//! an I/O APIC left as firmware set it up is an I/O APIC that may still be
//! delivering the PIT's interrupt to a vector the kernel has other plans for.
//!
//! # Why the timer is calibrated rather than read
//!
//! The local APIC timer counts at the core crystal's frequency divided by
//! whatever the divide register says, and on most machines nothing reports
//! that frequency. `CPUID` leaf 0x15 does on recent Intel parts and nowhere
//! else. So it is measured against the counter `super::clock` brought up a
//! moment earlier, which is the same thing every other kernel does.
