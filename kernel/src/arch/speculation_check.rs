//! The boot check for the side-channel defences.
//!
//! Run after stage 7's programs, so that there has been a switch of address
//! space to issue a barrier at. What it can check, it checks:
//!
//! * the clamp: an index inside its bound comes back itself, and -- on the
//!   path a misprediction takes, the clamp run without the check before it --
//!   one outside comes back zero in a hardened build and unchanged in one
//!   built with `--mitigations off`;
//! * every processor that is running recorded what it applied, and nothing it
//!   wrote to the processor failed to read back;
//! * a hardened build applied at least the clamp everywhere, and an unhardened
//!   one applied nothing anywhere;
//! * where any processor's plan has a switch barrier, programs in different
//!   address spaces have run, so at least one was issued -- any processor's,
//!   not the boot processor's, because on `AArch64` each core decides for
//!   itself, and a machine that boots on a core that needs no barrier may
//!   start others that do;
//! * no processor issued a switch barrier its own plan does not have;
//! * whatever the architecture adds: on x86-64, that `VERW`'s operand is one
//!   the instruction takes, on a machine whose exit path may not have run it.
//!
//! What it cannot check is that any of this stops an attack. That is a
//! property of the processor, and `docs/certification/SPECULATION.md` says
//! which vendor statement each defence rests on.
