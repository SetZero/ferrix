//! Processors on `AArch64`.
//!
//! On an ACPI machine the MADT's GIC CPU interface entries *are* the processor
//! list: one per core, each carrying that core's `MPIDR_EL1` affinity, which
//! is the number PSCI takes to start it. On a machine described by a device
//! tree instead -- the Pixel 7 -- the list is `/cpus`, whose `reg` is the same
//! number, and PSCI's conduit is the `/psci` node's `method`.
//!
//! # Starting one
//!
//! PSCI's `CPU_ON` starts a core at a physical address, with its MMU and
//! caches off and one argument in `x0`. Everything the kernel runs on — its
//! image, its stacks, its per-CPU records — is in the upper half and reachable
//! only through page tables, so the first instructions have to install those
//! tables and turn the MMU on while executing at an address that means
//! something only with it off. That is the problem the loader solves at boot,
//! and the answer is the same: an identity map of the few instructions that
//! straddle the switch.
//!
//! The identity map here is private to bring-up. It maps the page holding the
//! entry sequence at its own physical address, in a tree of its own that only
//! a starting core's `TTBR0_EL1` ever points at, and it is freed once every
//! core has left it.
