//! The Generic Interrupt Controller, version 2.
//!
//! Two register blocks, and the split matters. The **distributor** is
//! machine-wide: it decides which CPU an interrupt goes to and whether it is
//! enabled at all. The **CPU interface** is per-core: it is what the core
//! reads to find out which interrupt arrived and writes to say it is done.
//!
//! Three kinds of interrupt, distinguished only by number, which is why the
//! constants below are worth naming: 0..16 are software-generated, 16..32 are
//! *private* peripherals — each core has its own, and the architected timer is
//! one — and 32 upwards are shared peripherals.
//!
//! GICv3 replaces the CPU interface with system registers and adds a
//! redistributor per core. It is not here yet: `init` reports the version it
//! found and refuses one it cannot drive, rather than writing GICv2 layouts
//! into GICv3 registers and producing a machine that takes no interrupts for
//! reasons nothing explains.
