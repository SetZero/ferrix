//! Which console this machine has: the PL011 UART, a 16550 behind `MMIO`, or
//! on a machine without either the kernel can reach, a console record in
//! `ramoops` memory.
//!
//! One of the two device drivers inside the kernel — see `crate::console` for
//! why it is here at all rather than in userspace. The PL011 is
//! `arch::arm_common::pl011`, shared with ARMv7-A; the other two are this
//! architecture's alone and live here.
//!
//! The `ramoops` backend is for the Pixel 7, whose UART is behind a debug
//! accessory on its USB-C port. Its loader passes
//! `console=ramoops,<address>,<size>`, naming the console zone of the region
//! Android's kernel keeps its log in, and has already started a record there;
//! this appends to it, in Linux's `persistent_ram_buffer` format, so the boot
//! log survives the watchdog reset that ends a run and Android shows it as
//! `/sys/fs/pstore/console-ramoops-0`. It has no input and never waits.
//!
//! The 16550 is for the guest crosvm makes on the Pixel 7, whose console is an
//! `ns16550a` at `MMIO` `0x3f8`: `console=uart8250,mmio,<address>`, as Linux
//! spells it. Its registers are bytes, one apart. It is polled both ways, and
//! crosvm's port sends each byte as it is written.
//!
//! Unlike x86-64's 16550, these are `MMIO`, so it has to be *mapped* before
//! it can be written, and mapped as device memory: through a normal cacheable
//! mapping the writes may be merged, reordered or held in a cache line, and the
//! symptom is a console that prints nothing at all.
