//! A synthetic ELF image, for the loader's self-check.
//!
//! The loader has to be exercised on the machine, because what it produces is
//! page tables and there is no way to check those from the host. That needs an
//! image, and the alternatives to building one here are worse: a binary
//! committed to the tree would be three binaries, one per architecture, none
//! of them readable in a diff, and all of them stale the moment the loader's
//! assumptions changed.
//!
//! So the check builds its own, for whichever architecture it is running on,
//! with the shape that matters — a read-execute segment covering the headers
//! and a read-write one with more `p_memsz` than `p_filesz`, which is how
//! `.bss` is expressed and the one part of loading with nothing to copy.
//!
//! Deliberately not a general ELF writer. It emits exactly what the check
//! needs and is wrong for anything else: no sections, no dynamic table, no
//! alignment congruence between file offset and virtual address.
