//! The signal return page: code the kernel maps into every process for a
//! handler installed without `SA_RESTORER` to return through, on an
//! architecture whose C libraries could not read the vDSO image (F-48).
//!
//! ARMv7-A's programs are 32-bit, and the vDSO image is a 64-bit ELF, which a
//! 32-bit C library given `AT_SYSINFO_EHDR` would misread. So ARMv7-A gets no
//! vDSO, and Linux's answer instead: one page of return sequences, mapped
//! read-and-run wherever the vDSO would go, told to nobody through the
//! auxiliary vector, and named only by the link register a signal frame
//! leaves (`arch/arm/kernel/signal.c`'s `sigpage`). Without it the frame's
//! own copy of the sequence was the return address, on a stack no page of
//! which may run, and a handler that returned was killed.
//!
//! Built once, from `arch::sigpage_code`, and never written again: every
//! process shares the one page, and none may write it.
