//! Stage 7's self-checks: the dispatch path, on the real architecture.
//!
//! These do something the host tests in `libs/linux-abi` cannot, and it is the
//! whole reason they exist. That crate checks all three number tables against
//! each other; what it cannot check is *which one this kernel was built to
//! use*. A build that reached for the wrong table would pass every host test
//! and then answer a program's `write` with `unlink`, and nothing short of
//! running on the machine can tell the difference.
//!
//! So the checks below assert the identity of the table by its content: they
//! ask for a number that means one thing on this architecture and something
//! else, or nothing, on the other two.
//!
//! The second thing they establish is that the path is total. A trap vector
//! has nowhere to report a failure to — a program is sitting on the other end
//! of it — so `dispatch` has to end in a value for every input, including the
//! numbers no table has.
