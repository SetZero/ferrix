//! The native calls' refusals that stage 9's check does not make: a handle of
//! the wrong kind, one without the right a call needs, one named twice in a
//! message, a table with no room, a send whose cycle check would walk too far,
//! a packet whose buffer faults, a copy through a VMO a device reads past the
//! caches, a clock asked for badly, the kernel log asked for by a device
//! that may not read it, a bootstrap handle or a message's handles with no
//! room or no memory to be placed in, and a write with no memory for its
//! message, which keeps the handles it carried (F-42). And the job limits a
//! program sets, read back as it set them.
//!
//! Each is a sentence `docs/NATIVE-ABI.md` promises a program: which status
//! it gets, and that a refused call leaves what it was given where it was.
//! Driven through [`native::dispatch`] from one process of the check's own,
//! as stage 9's check drives the calls that succeed.
