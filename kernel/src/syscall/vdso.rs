//! The vDSO: the page of code every Linux program is given to read the clock
//! with, and the page of data that code reads.
//!
//! `libs/vdso` lays the image out and holds its code; this is the kernel's
//! half. The two pages are one object, built the first time a program is
//! started and kept for good, held in place so that nothing -- no `madvise`,
//! no reclaim -- ever takes a frame out from under the processes mapping it.
//! Each program's exec maps it, the data page read-only and the image
//! read-and-run above it, and tells the program where with `AT_SYSINFO_EHDR`.
//! glibc and musl find `__vdso_clock_gettime` there and call it instead of
//! making the system call. Chrome made forty thousand of those calls a second.
//!
//! # What the data page holds, and keeping it true
//!
//! Which counter the kernel reads, the counter's frequency, and the real-time
//! clock's offset from it: `libs/vdso` names the words. The first two are
//! set when the page is built and never change. The offset changes whenever
//! the real-time clock is set, and each change is written here under the same
//! lock as the kernel's own copy is stored, so that the page cannot be left
//! behind by a change made while the page was being built. One aligned store
//! of one word is the whole update, so a program reading it concurrently sees
//! the old offset or the new one, never half of each.
//!
//! # x86-64 only
//!
//! The one architecture with code for it (`crate::arch::vdso_spec`), and the
//! one a browser runs on. On the others there is no image, no mapping and no
//! `AT_SYSINFO_EHDR`, and the C library makes the system call, as it did
//! before.
