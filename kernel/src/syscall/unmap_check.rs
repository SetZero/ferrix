//! An unmap on one processor waits for a copy on another to let go of its page.
//!
//! Every copy to or from a program runs inside `AddressSpace::with_page`, which
//! holds the space's lock from the translation to the end of the copy, and an
//! unmap takes the same lock before it takes the translation down and gives
//! the frame back. With threads that is what stands between a `write` copying
//! from a buffer and another thread's `munmap` of it: without it the copy
//! reads, or writes, a frame already handed to somebody else.
//!
//! The check makes the race slow enough to see. A task on one processor holds
//! a page inside `with_page` for a fixed time; a task on another starts an
//! unmap of that page while it does. The unmap must not have returned when the
//! copy ends, and must have returned once both tasks are gone. A `with_page`
//! that let the lock go before the copy lets the unmap through at once, and
//! fails by name. It needs two processors, and on one it does not run.
//!
//! What it shows is the kernel's half of the race, at the call every copy goes
//! through: a user program of two threads, one in `write` and one in `munmap`,
//! reaches the same call.
