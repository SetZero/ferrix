//! A program's file, as `execve` loads it: read for its headers, mapped for
//! its pages.
//!
//! Until 2026-09-24 `execve` read the whole file into kernel memory and the
//! loader copied each segment out of that copy, which held a program to the
//! 64 MiB `crate::fs::read_file` will read and paid for every page of it
//! whether the program touched it or not. Chrome is 198 MB. What the kernel
//! needs from the file before it can decide anything is only the first bytes
//! -- the `#!` line of a script, or an ELF's file header and program header
//! table -- and what it needs afterwards is the file's pages, which the page
//! cache already has as an object a mapping can name. So that is what this
//! holds: the open file, its length, those first bytes, and the object.
//!
//! # Which files are mapped, and which copied
//!
//! A file whose pages are one VMO -- tmpfs, the initramfs unpacked into it,
//! and btrfs through its page cache -- is mapped (see `load.rs`). A file with
//! no such object is still loaded, a segment at a time through a small buffer,
//! so it too can be any size; it is only not paged in on demand.
