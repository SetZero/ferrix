//! Reading and writing a user program's memory.
//!
//! Every system call that takes a pointer goes through here. That is the point
//! of the module: there is exactly one place where the kernel touches memory a
//! program chose the address of, so there is exactly one place to get the
//! checks right and one place to change when the hardware starts helping.
//!
//! # Why not just dereference it
//!
//! Three reasons, and each of them is a bug that has been shipped by somebody.
//!
//! **The address may not be mapped yet.** A user page is reserved by `mmap`
//! and paid for on first touch. The program may have written to a buffer, or
//! may only have reserved it; either way the kernel is often the first to
//! touch a given page. Dereferencing would fault in the kernel, on a kernel
//! stack, at a point where the fault handler cannot tell a legitimate
//! demand-paged access from a wild pointer. So the copy asks
//! [`AddressSpace::fault`] first, deliberately, and a page that cannot be
//! faulted in is [`UserError::Fault`] — a clean `EFAULT` to the program rather
//! than a kernel fault.
//!
//! **The address may not be the program's.** Nothing stops a program passing
//! a kernel address as a buffer. On this tree nothing in the *hardware* stops
//! the kernel following it either: no SMAP on x86-64, no PAN on Arm, not yet.
//! The bound check below is therefore the only thing between a user pointer
//! and a read of kernel memory at kernel privilege, which is why it is the
//! first statement in both functions and why it happens before any arithmetic
//! that could wrap.
//!
//! **The program's tables are not the kernel's.** A user address means nothing
//! in the kernel's own translation until the space is installed on this
//! processor, and even then only for the lower half. The copy resolves through
//! the target [`AddressSpace`] explicitly and reaches the page through the
//! direct map, so it works on a space that is *not* installed anywhere — which
//! is what `execve` needs when it writes an argument vector into a space the
//! processor has not switched to yet.
//!
//! # Page at a time, and why the bound is checked twice
//!
//! A user buffer is contiguous in the program's address space and need not be
//! contiguous in physical memory, so the copy is split at page boundaries and
//! each page resolved separately. The end of the range is bound-checked before
//! the loop *and* each page is checked as it is reached, because the first
//! check proves the caller asked for something sensible and the second proves
//! the walk stayed inside it.
//!
//! # Each page is copied under the space's lock
//!
//! Resolving a page and then copying through it with no lock held leaves a gap
//! in which another thread of the same process can unmap the page, and the
//! copy then lands in a frame that belongs to somebody else by now. So each
//! page's copy runs inside [`AddressSpace::with_page`], which holds the page's
//! translation still until the copy is done. Nothing reaches that gap today --
//! a process has one thread, and `vfork` copies the space rather than sharing
//! it -- but `clone(CLONE_VM)` will, and nothing about the copy would say so.
