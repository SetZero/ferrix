//! The Pixel 7's system on chip, Tensor G2 (`gs201`): its two watchdogs.
//!
//! ABL hands over with both running -- `watchdog_cl0@10060000` and
//! `watchdog_cl1@10070000`, Samsung's `s3c2410` design -- and before this
//! module nothing serviced them, so every boot on the phone ended in a
//! watchdog reset about half a minute in, whatever the kernel was doing.
//!
//! They are not simply stopped, because they are also this phone's only
//! record of a run. The console is a `ramoops` record in RAM, and a watchdog
//! reset is the one reset measured to keep it (`bootloaders/pixel7/README.md`).
//! So the kernel keeps them fed while it is alive -- a task writes each one's
//! reload value back into its counter every [`FEED_INTERVAL`] -- and a kernel
//! that hangs, or stops scheduling that task, is still reset with its log
//! intact. And where the kernel means to stop the machine, [`reset_now`]
//! makes a watchdog fire at once: powering the phone off would lose the log,
//! and PSCI's reset is unproven here.
//!
//! Nothing happens on a machine whose tree has neither watchdog.
