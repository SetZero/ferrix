//! The kernel is entered with three mappings and no way to make a fourth: the
//! loader's page table pool belongs to the loader, and the buddy allocator does
//! not exist until stage 2. That is a problem immediately, because on `AArch64`
//! the console is an `MMIO` register that has to be mapped as device memory
//! before it can be written.
//!
//! So the kernel carries its own frames, in `.bss`, and reaches physical memory
//! through the direct map the loader left. That is enough to install a mapping,
//! which is all early boot needs.
