//! The reverse map and the scoped shootdown, checked from user mode.
//!
//! What a VMO taking a page away has to get right cannot be seen in page
//! tables. A table with the entry gone proves the kernel took it down; it
//! proves nothing about a processor that cached the entry before, and under
//! hardware virtualisation that cache is a real TLB that keeps answering until
//! somebody tells it not to. So the accesses that matter here are made by
//! programs, in user mode, on processors other than the one doing the taking.
//!
//! Two processes share one `MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS` object across a fork:
//! the parent pinned to the processor this check runs on, the child to
//! another. Page 0 of the object is the page under test; page 1 is a control
//! page, on which the kernel writes each program a command and the program
//! writes back what it saw. Each program touches page 0 until told to hold
//! still — reading the control page only, so its TLB entry for page 0 stays
//! warm — and then the kernel, on this processor:
//!
//! 1. decommits page 0, requires both spaces' tables to have lost it, claims
//!    back the very frame it gave up and fills it with a poison pattern, and
//!    has the child read and write page 0: it must read zeros, not poison, and
//!    its write must land in a fresh frame while the poisoned one keeps its
//!    poison;
//! 2. replaces page 0 with a frame of its own filled with a pattern, and does
//!    the same: the child must read the pattern, write into the new frame, and
//!    leave the old frame's poison alone;
//! 3. holds page 0 for a device, decommits and replaces over the hold, and
//!    requires both spaces to still reach the held frame and the child to
//!    still read the marker it wrote;
//! 4. has the child write page 0 and hold still, protects page 0 read-only
//!    in the child's space, and has it write again: the write must fault and
//!    end the child with `SIGSEGV`, not land through the writable entry its
//!    processor cached before the protect.
//!
//! Without the reverse map, step 1's poisoned frame is still mapped and the
//! child reads it. With the reverse map but no shootdown to the child's
//! processor, the child's warm TLB entry reads it all the same.
