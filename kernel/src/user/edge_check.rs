//! Stage 6's edges: what an address space and its objects refuse, and the
//! rarer ways they succeed, called by name (finding F-10).
//!
//! The system calls reach most of this through their own argument checks,
//! which refuse a malformed request before the space sees it -- so the
//! space's own refusals, which are what stands between a caller that forgot a
//! check and a mapping of the kernel, ran on no boot. Each is asked for here,
//! directly, with exactly the error it has to answer; and the paths no program
//! in the suite takes -- a window a GPU's blob would be mapped through, an
//! `mremap` that grows where it is or over pages another region names, a page
//! a device holds refusing to move, a page another object shares copied
//! before a write -- are taken, with what they must leave behind.
