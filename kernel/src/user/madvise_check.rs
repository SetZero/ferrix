//! The self-check of `madvise`.
//!
//! What `PartitionAlloc` and V8 rely on is that a range dropped with
//! `MADV_DONTNEED` or `MADV_FREE` stays mapped and its frames go back to the
//! allocator at once. So the check counts them: eight pages of private
//! anonymous memory are written, dropped, and must come back as exactly eight
//! frames in a [`mm::FrameWindow`] -- a page on either side of the range stays
//! written, so no page table empties and the count is the pages' alone --
//! and then read as zeros, while the pages beside them keep what they held.
//! `MADV_FREE` must do the same.
//!
//! Around that: a page a `fork` child still shares copy-on-write keeps the
//! child's contents when its parent drops it. A private mapping of a memfd
//! gives back the two pages it copied and shows the file there again, and the
//! file keeps every page. A shared mapping of it only loses its translations,
//! and still shows what it wrote. `MADV_REMOVE` punches a hole in shared
//! anonymous memory that a `fork` child sees too, and gives the hole's two
//! frames back. The hints are accepted and drop nothing. And the refusals are
//! Linux's: an address off a page boundary, advice there is none of, the
//! advice this kernel cannot honour, a length that wraps, `MADV_FREE` and
//! `MADV_REMOVE` where they do not apply, and a range with a hole in it, which
//! is `ENOMEM` once the mapped part has been advised. The run is done twice
//! and must keep no frame.
