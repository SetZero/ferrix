//! Every allocation the memory layer's operations make, failed in turn
//! (findings F-10 and F-23).
//!
//! `object/alloc_check.rs` fails every `n`th allocation of a round of native
//! calls, for a few `n`: a sample, which lands where the round's order puts
//! it. This is the other half. It takes the address space's and the objects'
//! operations -- a fork of a space holding every kind of region, an `mremap`
//! that moves a private region and one that grows and shrinks a shared one,
//! an unmap that splits, a VMO shared, written, held and forked, kernel stacks
//! freed together -- and runs each once per allocation it makes, failing that
//! allocation alone: the first run fails the first, the second the second,
//! until a run in which nothing failed. So every allocation site the scenario
//! reaches is made to fail once, whatever order it comes in.
//!
//! Every run must end in success or in running out of memory -- never another
//! refusal, never a panic -- and the run in which nothing failed must succeed
//! whole. Each scenario builds what it needs from nothing and drops all of it,
//! so a failure part-way that kept a frame shows as a frame the sweep did not
//! give back, counted over every run of every scenario.
