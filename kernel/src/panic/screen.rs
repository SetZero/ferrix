//! The panic report, drawn on the framebuffer firmware left behind.
//!
//! Serial is where a panic is reported first, and on a machine with a cable
//! attached nothing here matters. A machine with a screen and no cable — a
//! board on a desk — shows nothing at all without this, and that is the case
//! it exists for.
//!
//! What it draws is the console's recent output, the same bytes the serial
//! port carried, which by the time this runs end with the report itself. So
//! the screen and the log cannot disagree, and there is no second copy of the
//! report to keep in step. The report is picked out from the boot log above it
//! by colour, from its `FERRIX-PANIC` line on.
//!
//! Beside the text is a QR code of the report itself, as plain text: a photo
//! of a screen is how a report leaves a machine with no cable, and a photo of
//! a code carries every character where a photo of text loses some. It holds
//! as much of the report as a code with modules of at least
//! [`MIN_MODULE_PIXELS`] can on this screen, cut at a line, from the marker
//! line down, so what is lost to a small screen is the end of the explanation
//! and never the headline.
//!
//! This is the kernel's second output device after the serial port, and it is
//! the same kind of exception `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` makes for that one:
//! written, never read, and configured no further than firmware left it. A
//! panic draws on it once; the boot console (`console::screen`) draws the
//! kernel's lines on it before that, only when the command line asks.
