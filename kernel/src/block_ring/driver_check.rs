//! The boot check that starts the ring-3 virtio-blk driver and reads the
//! test disk through it: stage 10's exit, the half that is a driver in ring
//! 3 reading sectors with the IOMMU on, and stage 11's disk.
//!
//! `devmgr` will start block drivers; until it lands, and for the boot check
//! either way, the kernel starts one itself the way `devmgr` will: a process
//! made from `/sbin/blk` in the initramfs, given the device with `MANAGE`
//! and the driver's end of a ring's control channel over its bootstrap
//! channel, in the one START message `docs/BLOCK-RING.md` §6 fixes and
//! `block_ring::start_for` fills from the device node. Every call the
//! starter makes goes through the native dispatcher from a process of its
//! own, as `block_ring::check` and stage 9's process checks do, so nothing
//! here reaches the kernel by a path a program could not.
//!
//! A driver is started for every virtio-blk function, in PCI order, named
//! `vda`, `vdb` and so on as `devmgr` would name them; the second serves the
//! btrfs fixture stage 11's exit mounts next. What the check requires: each
//! driver's HELLO accepted and its disk published under the name START gave
//! it, within the patience; then sectors of the first disk
//! read through the registry's [`BlockDevice`] — the same path a mount takes
//! — come back exactly as `xtask` wrote the test disk, whose layout is fixed
//! in `xtask/src/test_disk.rs` and repeated here in [`expected`]. A driver
//! that exits before publishing fails the check with its exit status printed,
//! which names the step it stopped at.
//!
//! The driver is left running. Its disk stays in `/dev` for what comes after
//! this check — a btrfs mount of the next disk is stage 11's exit — and the
//! process ends with the machine.
