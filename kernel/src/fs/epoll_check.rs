//! The self-check of epoll: what a Wayland server's event loop asks of it.
//!
//! A set is made by number, as a program makes one, and watches pipes. A
//! level-triggered registration reports an unread pipe at every wait; an
//! edge-triggered one reports it once, and again only after more is written
//! -- the level-triggered registration beside it on the same pipe is the
//! control that the second wait was not simply blind. A one-shot registration
//! reports once and is quiet until `EPOLL_CTL_MOD` arms it again. With room
//! for one event, two ready pipes are reported by turns. A registration
//! outlives its number while a `dup` holds the file, and goes with the file.
//!
//! Each registration reports only the events it asked for: `EPOLLIN`, not the
//! `EPOLLRDNORM` a pipe's readiness also carries.
//!
//! Nesting: a set holding another is readable, and reports the inner set's
//! cookie, when the inner set has something to report; a set added to itself
//! is `EINVAL`, one added to a set it holds is `ELOOP`, and a chain of six
//! sets is `ELOOP` where five are not.
//!
//! And the refusals, each as Linux answers it: flags `epoll_create1` does not
//! take, a size `epoll_create` does not take, a read at an offset (where
//! `lseek` answers 0, as Linux's `noop_llseek` does), `EEXIST`, `ENOENT`,
//! `EPERM` for a directory, `EINVAL` for a descriptor that is not a set, an
//! unknown operation and `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` misused, `EBADF`, `EFAULT` for an event that
//! cannot be read but not for `EPOLL_CTL_DEL`, which reads none, and for the
//! wait: `maxevents` before the buffer, the buffer before the descriptor, and a
//! signal set of the wrong size before anything. It runs twice and counts
//! frames across the second run.
