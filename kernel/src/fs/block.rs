//! What the kernel needs from a disk: whole sectors, read and written on
//! request, and a flush that says when they are durable.
//!
//! Stage 11 mounts a btrfs volume from a virtio-blk disk served by a ring-3
//! driver, and `mount(2)` names that disk by a node in `/dev`. Opening a block
//! node is `ENXIO` here, as it is for every block number no driver answers, so
//! a mount does not open it: it resolves the node's `st_rdev` through the
//! registry in [`crate::fs::devfs`] and reads through the device that returns.
//! This trait is all that registry knows about a disk, which is what lets it
//! exist before stage 11's concrete kernel disk does.
//!
//! # Lifetime
//!
//! The registry hands out an `Arc`, and a mount keeps it. So a disk can
//! outlive its registration — its driver died, devmgr removed it, a reset is
//! pending — and a device in that state has to keep answering: every read
//! fails with `EIO`, promptly, and nothing panics.
