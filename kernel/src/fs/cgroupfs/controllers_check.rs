//! The `cpu`, `memory` and `pids` controllers through cgroupfs: the files a
//! Linux program sees are the job's quota (`object::quota`, `FRU_RSA.1`).
//!
//! The root enables the three, and a child cgroup gets their files and
//! `cgroup.controllers` lists them. `pids.max`, `memory.max` and `cpu.weight`
//! take what Linux takes and refuse what it refuses, and read back as Linux
//! prints them; each write reaches the job, as a native `job_get_quota`
//! would read it. A process moved in counts in `pids.current`, and a process
//! forked there past `pids.max` is refused and counted in `pids.events`. The
//! root then disables them again, so nothing after sees them on.
