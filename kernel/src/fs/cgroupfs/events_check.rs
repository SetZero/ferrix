//! Stage 13's `POLLPRI` check, landing G3 (`docs/CGROUPS.md` §4): a service
//! manager learns that a cgroup emptied by waiting on its `cgroup.events`.
//!
//! A cgroup gets two members, and its `cgroup.events`, read once, goes into
//! an epoll set asking for `EPOLLPRI`. A task waits on the set as
//! `epoll_wait` does. The first member's release leaves the cgroup populated
//! and the waiter asleep; the second's empties it, and the waiter comes back
//! with `EPOLLPRI` and the cookie, ended by the job's wake rather than its own
//! recheck. Then the file polls `POLLPRI` (and is in `select`'s exception
//! set) until it is read again, and not after.
