//! A delegated cgroup's own limits stay its delegator's.
//!
//! Root makes `/check-l`, enables `memory`, `pids` and `cpu` above it, sets
//! its `memory.max` to 16 MiB, and `chown`s the directory and its
//! `cgroup.procs` to uid 1000, as init delegates a `Delegate=yes` unit. The
//! delegatee, uid 1000 in every id, is given its job by `job_for_cgroup` with
//! `MANAGE` and without `SET_LIMIT`, since it may write `cgroup.procs` and not
//! the limit files. Then, each refused with `ACCESS_DENIED`: asking
//! `job_for_cgroup` for `SET_LIMIT`, `job_set_limit` on the job for memory,
//! tasks and processor weight, a duplicate asked with `SET_LIMIT`, and
//! `job_set_limit` through a duplicate asked with the same rights -- a right
//! is only ever dropped, so a duplicate cannot regain one. Through the files,
//! an open for writing of its own `memory.max`, `pids.max` and `cpu.weight`
//! is refused `EACCES`, and `memory.max` still reads 16 MiB afterwards.
//!
//! What it may limit is what it makes: a job it makes with `job_create`
//! inside its own carries `SET_LIMIT`, and a limit set on that is accepted.
//! Such a limit may exceed the delegated job's as a number, and binds nothing
//! beyond it: every job's use is charged to each of its ancestors
//! (`object::quota`).
