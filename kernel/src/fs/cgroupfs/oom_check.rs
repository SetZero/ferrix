//! Stage 13's scoped OOM kill check, the rest of landing M1
//! (`docs/CGROUPS.md` §6 and §7.1, `object::oom`).
//!
//! A program (`arch::USER_OOM_PROGRAM`) that writes a byte to each page of
//! 8 MiB runs in `/check-m/v`, whose `memory.max` is 1 MiB. Beside it,
//! `/check-s` holds a process with 2 MiB resident -- more than the program
//! can reach, so a kill that chose the largest process anywhere would choose
//! it. The program must end by `SIGKILL`, the sibling must still be alive,
//! `memory.events` must count one OOM kill in `v` and in `/check-m` above
//! it and nothing in `/check-s`, and an epoll set watching `v`'s
//! `memory.events` for `EPOLLPRI` must have been woken by the kill, the
//! file polling `POLLPRI` until it is read again from its start.
