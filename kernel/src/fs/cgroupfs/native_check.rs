//! Stage 13's native side of a cgroup, landing G5 (`docs/CGROUPS.md` §5): a
//! native service manager holds the job behind a cgroup and waits for it to
//! empty, as a Linux one waits on `cgroup.events`.
//!
//! A check process, making its calls through the native dispatch as a program
//! would, opens a cgroup's directory and asks `job_for_cgroup` for its job:
//! as root it gets `WAIT` and `MANAGE`, as uid 1000, who may only read the
//! directory's `cgroup.procs`, `WAIT` and not `MANAGE`. A descriptor not
//! open, and one of a directory that is not a cgroup, are refused.
//!
//! Then `EMPTY`. The job asserts it while nothing is in it, stops when two
//! members are moved in, and a port registration for it stays quiet through
//! the first member's release and fires at the last's, at once, with
//! `cgroup.events` already saying `populated 0`. A registration made while
//! the job is empty fires as it is made. A native job made inside the
//! cgroup's job shows as `job-<id>` beside it, keeps the cgroup from being
//! removed, and goes when its handle is closed.
