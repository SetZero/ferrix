//! The self-check of signalfds.
//!
//! Made by number, a signalfd takes `SFD_NONBLOCK` and `SFD_CLOEXEC`, refuses
//! every other flag, a mask of the wrong size, a mask it cannot read, and a
//! descriptor to change that is no signalfd, and never reads `SIGKILL` or
//! `SIGSTOP`. With nothing pending it reads `EAGAIN` and does not poll
//! readable. A signal sent to the process and pending makes it readable, and a
//! read takes it -- its `signalfd_siginfo` names the signal, `SI_USER` and the
//! sender -- and leaves it pending no longer. A signal outside the mask is not
//! read and stays pending until `signalfd4` hands the descriptor a mask that
//! holds it. Two pending signals come back in one read, lowest first.
//!
//! The one that matters most: a blocked `read`, a `poll` and an `epoll_wait`,
//! each in a task of its own and each waiting before the signal is sent, are
//! ended by the wake the signal's arrival makes, not by their own one-second
//! recheck -- the wake count says which, and the time from the send to the
//! waiter coming back must stay under [`LATE_LIMIT_NANOS`], a quarter of that
//! recheck.
//!
//! Refused as Linux refuses: a read into fewer than 128 bytes, a write, and a
//! read at an offset. `lseek` answers 0, as Linux's `noop_llseek` does. The run
//! is done twice and must keep no frame.
