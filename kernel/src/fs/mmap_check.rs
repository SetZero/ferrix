//! Stage 8's self-check of shared file mappings.
//!
//! A shared mapping of a tmpfs file maps the file's own pages, the VMO `read`
//! copies out of, so a write through the mapping is what the file's next read
//! returns and a write to the file is what the mapping shows, with no copy in
//! between to go stale. The check drives that as a program would, from a
//! process built for it: `openat` and `mmap` go in by the handlers, the
//! mapping is read and written through user memory so that every touch takes
//! the fault path, and the file is read and written through its open
//! description.
//!
//! Around that, `mmap` must refuse a file as Linux does, `msync` must answer
//! as Linux does, `/proc/<pid>/maps` must name the mapping by the file's path,
//! and a truncation must take the pages past the new end away from the
//! mapping, which a copy from the kernel then finds refused.
//!
//! A private mapping of the same file must show the file until it writes a
//! page, and then keep that page to itself: a write through it, a `read` into
//! it, and a write by a `fork` child never reach the file or a shared mapping,
//! while a write to the file still shows through the pages it has not copied.
//! A truncation takes its copies past the cut too, so the file grown back
//! shows zeros there, as on Linux. And a program writes a page of one from user
//! mode that it has only read so far, which must copy rather than fault on the
//! file's read-only page forever. Like the other stage 8 checks it runs twice
//! and counts frames across the second run, in a frame window.
