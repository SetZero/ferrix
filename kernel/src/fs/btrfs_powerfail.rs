//! Stage 12's exit, the other half: a machine switched off in the middle of
//! a transaction, and a mount that has to make sense of what is on the disk.
//!
//! The host drives it. `cargo xtask test-powerfail` boots with
//! `ferrix.btrfs=churn`, waits for the marker below, kills QEMU at a random
//! moment, runs host `btrfs check` over the image, boots the same image again
//! with `ferrix.btrfs=replay` — which mounts it, and mounting replays
//! whatever log the crash left — and runs `btrfs check` once more, which must
//! find nothing at all.
//!
//! # What the guest can judge by itself
//!
//! Not much about *which* version of a file it should find: it is a fresh
//! machine, and everything it knew died with the last one. So the churn
//! writes files that can be judged on their own. Each pass writes a file's
//! body, makes it durable, and only then appends a 32-byte trailer naming
//! the body's length and its CRC-32C, durable in its turn. A file that ends
//! in a well-formed trailer is therefore a file whose body was promised
//! before that trailer was: its bytes must be the ones the trailer counts,
//! and if they are not, something rolled a completed promise back. A file
//! with no trailer was being written when the power went, and POSIX promises
//! nothing about it, so nothing is asked of it.
//!
//! That is the same rule the host-side crash tests in `libs/btrfs-write`
//! apply, at a thousand cuts a second rather than one a boot; this half is
//! what puts a real driver, a real block ring and a real host filesystem's
//! flushes under it.
