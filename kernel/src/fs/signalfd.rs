//! Signalfds: the signals pending for a process, read through a descriptor,
//! the object behind `signalfd4`.
//!
//! A signalfd holds a mask and nothing else. A read takes the pending signals
//! in the mask -- the reading thread's own first, then its process's, as
//! `rt_sigtimedwait` takes them -- and answers a 128-byte `struct
//! signalfd_siginfo` for each, as many as the buffer holds; with none pending
//! it waits, interruptibly, or is `EAGAIN`. `poll` answers readable while one
//! is pending, never writable. A program blocks the signals first, so that
//! they wait to be read rather than being delivered, and hands the descriptor
//! to its event loop: glib's and Chrome's take `SIGCHLD` and `SIGTERM` this
//! way.
//!
//! Linux's `fs/signalfd.c`, check for check: a buffer shorter than one
//! `signalfd_siginfo` is `EINVAL`, and so is a write, which has no operation;
//! the first signal may wait and the rest are only taken if already there; a
//! read interrupted by a signal outside the mask restarts under `SA_RESTART`.
//!
//! # Whose signals
//!
//! As on Linux, the reader's: the process of the task that reads or polls,
//! not the one that made the descriptor, so a `fork` child's copy reads the
//! child's. A kernel task reading on a process's behalf -- the boot check's --
//! is nobody's thread, and reads the process that made the descriptor, from
//! its own queue only.
//!
//! # Waking
//!
//! `poll` and `epoll_wait` trust a file whose every readiness change wakes one
//! of its queues, and then sleep a second between looks of their own. A
//! signalfd becomes readable when a signal is made pending, which the sender
//! does, not the reader; so every process has a queue of its own for this,
//! [`Process::signal_arrived`], which `Process::notify_signal` and
//! `notify_signal_to` wake for every signal they make pending. That is
//! Linux's `signalfd_wqh`, and the one wake a blocked signal gets: nothing
//! else wakes a thread for a signal it blocks. A change of mask wakes it too,
//! as `signalfd4` on an existing descriptor does on Linux. A read that takes a
//! signal only makes the descriptor less ready, which needs no wake.
