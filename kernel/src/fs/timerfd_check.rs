//! The self-check of timerfds.
//!
//! Made by number, a timer takes `TFD_NONBLOCK` and `TFD_CLOEXEC` and refuses
//! every other flag and every clock but the three it counts on. Disarmed, it
//! reads `EAGAIN`. Armed once, it is not readable before its deadline, then
//! reads 1 and is empty again. Armed at an absolute time in the past with an
//! interval, it is readable at once and reads every interval that has passed,
//! no fewer and no more than the clock says. `timerfd_gettime` reports the
//! time left and the interval, in both `itimerspec` layouts ARMv7-A has, a
//! setting answers the one it replaced, and a zero value disarms, keeping the
//! interval. A set of `CLOCK_REALTIME` fires an absolute real-time timer it
//! carried past, cancels one armed with `TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET`, whose read
//! is then `ECANCELED` once, and leaves a monotonic one alone.
//!
//! The one that matters most: a blocked `read`, a `poll` and an `epoll_wait`,
//! each in a task of its own and each waiting before the timer is armed, are
//! ended by the `timerfds` thread's wake at the deadline, not by their own
//! one-second recheck -- the wake count says which, and the time from the
//! deadline to the waiter coming back must stay under [`LATE_LIMIT_NANOS`],
//! a quarter of that recheck.
//!
//! Refused as Linux refuses: a read into fewer than eight bytes, a write, and
//! `lseek`. The run is done twice and must keep no frame, the thread's stack
//! included: with nothing armed it exits by itself.
