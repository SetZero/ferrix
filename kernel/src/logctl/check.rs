//! The log core's boot check, played from the driver's end of the channel.
//!
//! No machine the boot tests run on has a device whose binding may read the
//! log -- the Pixel 7's USB controller is the only one -- so the check claims
//! the log the way `log_control_create` does once the binding is judged, and
//! drives the channel as `usbdev` would. The binding's refusal, on every other
//! device, is the item's native call check's (`syscall/native_check.rs`).
//!
//! It requires: a first DATA from the oldest byte the log keeps, with what the
//! ring had already lost counted in it; a second that goes on from where the
//! first stopped; a second reader refused while the first holds the log; a
//! driver that breaks the protocol refused and its claim ended; and a claim
//! ended by its channel closing.
