//! What the machine does once boot has nothing left to run.
//!
//! By default it powers off: a QEMU run then ends, and `cargo xtask test-boot`
//! and `test-shell` read that as the end of the log. A board is different. A
//! powered-off STM32MP157-DK has to be unplugged and plugged in again before it
//! does anything, and the reset button does not bring it back, so every run on
//! it used to cost a hand at the board. `ferrix.onexit=reset` on the command
//! line asks for a reset instead, which lands back at the firmware's prompt,
//! ready for the next image.
//!
//! `ferrix.onexit=panic` asks for what Linux does when init exits: a panic,
//! here the one the catalog calls `FX-1501`. The disks are committed first,
//! which Linux does not do, because nothing is gained by losing them
//! (`docs/INIT.md` §8.3).
//!
//! The option is read once, early, rather than when boot ends: by then the
//! device tree may be unreachable for reasons that have nothing to do with it,
//! and a typo is better reported at the start of a log than discovered at the
//! end of one.
//!
//! # What power reaches without naming
//!
//! Two things above the certified item have to be told the machine is
//! stopping, and power names neither. A filesystem registers a [`Flush`],
//! and every registered one is committed before the machine stops, in the
//! order they were registered. A board whose firmware keeps a boot mode
//! registers a [`BootMode`], which `reboot(2)`'s RESTART2 word goes to.
//! Both are registered at bring-up, from `main.rs`, and the boot checks that
//! the flushes were before `init` can start a program that writes.
