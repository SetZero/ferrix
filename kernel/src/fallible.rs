//! Allocation that reports failure, for the certified item (finding F-23).
//!
//! The certified item allocates through this module and nowhere else, and
//! `scripts/check-fallible-alloc.py` holds it to that: a call to an
//! allocating standard-library API in the item's product code fails the
//! build unless it is argued at the site. Everything here returns
//! [`AllocError`] when memory has run out, and each caller turns that into
//! the answer its interface has for it -- `NO_MEMORY` from a native call,
//! `ENOMEM` from a Linux one, a refused bring-up step at boot.
//!
//! Two mechanisms, because the standard library offers two kinds of
//! allocation:
//!
//! * `Box`, `Vec`, `VecDeque` and `String` are made fallible directly, from
//!   stable parts, in `libs/fallible` where the host tests and Miri reach
//!   them. They are re-exported here unchanged.
//! * `Arc` and the ordered maps allocate inside `alloc` and cannot be. They
//!   run inside a reserved section (`mm/reserve.rs`): this processor's
//!   reserve is filled first, which is where the failure is reported, and the
//!   allocation itself is then served from the reserve if the heap refuses.
//!
//! # Failure injection
//!
//! [`inject`] makes every `n`th fallible allocation of one task fail, as if
//! memory had run out, without touching the heap. `object/alloc_check.rs`
//! drives the native ABI with it on every boot and requires every call to
//! either succeed or answer `NO_MEMORY`, and the kernel to be intact after.
//! Scoped to one task, so the rest of the machine -- which includes the
//! uncertified load, whose allocations are still infallible -- is untouched.
