//! A fence as a descriptor: what `VIRTGPU_EXECBUFFER` answers with
//! `VIRTGPU_EXECBUF_FENCE_FD_OUT`.
//!
//! A sync file on Linux, and the part of one Venus uses (`docs/GPU.md` §6.1):
//! `poll` says `POLLIN` once the submission it was made for has finished on
//! the device, and never before. Venus simulates its sync objects on nothing
//! else -- it polls these, duplicates them and closes them -- so Linux's
//! `SYNC_IOC_*` ioctls, which merge and inspect sync files, are not answered.
//!
//! The descriptor holds the renderer, not the submission: a fence whose driver
//! has gone reads as signalled, with an error, because nothing will ever
//! signal it and a program waiting on it would wait for ever.
