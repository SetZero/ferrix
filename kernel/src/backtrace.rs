//! Walking the call chain, for a panic report.
//!
//! The kernel is built with frame pointers on every architecture, which
//! `.cargo/config.toml` argues at the flag. Each frame therefore begins with
//! the previous frame's pointer and the address the call will return to, and
//! that is enough to say who called what without the unwind tables a
//! freestanding binary does not carry.
//!
//! # Trusting nothing
//!
//! This runs after something has already gone wrong, possibly on a stack that
//! is itself the problem. So every step is checked: the chain has to climb,
//! stay within one stack's worth of where it started, stay aligned, and land
//! on mapped pages — read straight from the page tables rather than through
//! [`crate::mm::translate`], whose lock the panicking processor may be holding.
//! Anything else ends the walk. A backtrace that stops early is a fact about
//! the machine; a fault inside the panic handler is a report nobody sees.
