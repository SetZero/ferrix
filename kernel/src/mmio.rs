//! Device registers.
//!
//! A device register is not memory: the read has a side effect, the write must
//! actually happen, and neither may be merged with its neighbour or hoisted
//! out of a loop. `read_volatile` and `write_volatile` are how Rust says that,
//! and this is the one place in the kernel that says it, through
//! `crate::arch::mmio` — everything else names a register through one of
//! these windows.
//!
//! On Arm, volatile is not enough. Under KVM a register access traps to the
//! hypervisor, which can only emulate a load or store whose syndrome it can
//! read: one register, no writeback. Volatile leaves the instruction to
//! LLVM, which folds the address arithmetic of repeated reads at one offset
//! into a pre-indexed `ldrh w, [x, #4]!`. Arm64 KVM then fails `KVM_RUN` with
//! ENOSYS ("Data abort outside memslots with no valid syndrome info"), and
//! crosvm stops the guest without a word. That is how the Pixel 7's VM
//! stopped after stage 10's DMA switch check. So each access goes through
//! `crate::arch::mmio`: on AArch64 and ARMv7-A one `ldr`/`str` in `asm!`,
//! with nothing but a base register, as Linux's `readl` and `writel` are,
//! and on x86-64 volatile, since KVM there decodes the instruction itself.
//!
//! A window with no base address reads zero and discards writes rather than
//! dereferencing null. That turns "the controller was never mapped" from
//! undefined behaviour into a value the caller can notice, which during
//! bring-up is the difference between a diagnosis and a triple fault.
