//! Device registers.
//!
//! A device register is not memory: the read has a side effect, the write must
//! actually happen, and neither may be merged with its neighbour or hoisted
//! out of a loop. `read_volatile` and `write_volatile` are how Rust says that,
//! and this is the one place in the kernel that says it — everything else
//! names a register through one of these windows.
//!
//! A window with no base address reads zero and discards writes rather than
//! dereferencing null. That turns "the controller was never mapped" from
//! undefined behaviour into a value the caller can notice, which during
//! bring-up is the difference between a diagnosis and a triple fault.
