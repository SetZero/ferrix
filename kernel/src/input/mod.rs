//! The input core: the kernel's end of an input driver's control channel, and
//! the `/dev/input/event<N>` nodes it publishes.
//!
//! `docs/INPUT.md` §3.1 and §3.2 are the design and `ferrix-inputctl` is
//! every word of the protocol and of the queues. A process holding a device
//! with `MANAGE` asks for a control channel with `INPUT_CONTROL_CREATE` and
//! hands its end to an input driver. One kernel task per device then:
//!
//! 1. waits for HELLO and checks it through [`Session::accept`] and the
//!    device's location, answering REFUSED with the first failure;
//! 2. publishes `/dev/input/event<N>` and answers READY with the node's
//!    number and a port;
//! 3. serves: every EVENTS the driver sends goes through the session, which
//!    refuses an event the device did not declare, keeps the device's state
//!    as Linux's input core does, and hands back whole reports; each report
//!    is appended to every open's queue, or to the grabbing open's alone;
//! 4. ends when the driver closes its end, says STOPPED, or breaks the
//!    protocol, taking the node away and revoking every open.
//!
//! # The kernel invents no events
//!
//! Not even a repeat: `docs/INPUT.md` §3.1 is a written deviation from Linux,
//! which repeats a held key for a device declaring `EV_REP`. Compositors
//! repeat keys themselves, so the core stores the delay and period for
//! `EVIOCGREP` and makes nothing of them.
