//! The kernel's early console.
//!
//! This is one of the two output devices the kernel drives itself, and
//! `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1 names both as the exceptions they are: every other
//! device is driven from userspace. The other is the framebuffer a panic is
//! drawn on (`panic/screen.rs`), which draws what this module keeps of its
//! recent output, and which [`screen`] draws these lines on as they are
//! printed when the command line asks for it. It exists because a panic before `devmgr` starts has to say
//! something, and because a boot test with no serial output cannot tell a
//! kernel that hung from one that never ran.
//!
//! The port itself is architecture-specific — a 16550 behind x86-64 I/O ports,
//! a PL011 behind `MMIO` on `AArch64` — so the bytes go out through
//! `arch::console`.
//!
//! # One line at a time
//!
//! The port is behind a lock, taken once per [`println!`], so two CPUs
//! printing at once produce two whole lines rather than one line of both.
//! Behind the lock is a ring of bytes waiting to be sent, which the port's
//! transmit interrupt empties once there is one, so that a writer does not
//! spend the whole of its write polling the port with interrupts masked: see
//! [`output`] for who queues and who still polls.
//!
//! The lock is also the one way the console can make a failure *worse*: a CPU
//! that faults while holding it — in the middle of formatting, say — would
//! report the fault by printing, wait for its own lock, and turn a
//! `FERRIX-PANIC` line into a boot test that times out saying nothing. So once
//! [`begin_panic`] has been called, a writer waits a bounded time for the lock
//! and then writes without it. A panic report interleaved with another CPU's
//! line is legible; one that never appears is not.
