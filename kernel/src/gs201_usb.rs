//! The kernel's part in the Pixel 7's USB device controller: a device node a
//! ring-3 driver is started on, and nothing else.
//!
//! The phone's USB-C port is a Synopsys DWC3 (`usb@11210000`, and the
//! `synopsys,dwc3` child that shares its window), which the phone's tree
//! puts in device mode. `native/drivers/usbdev` drives it, presenting a USB serial
//! port to whatever the phone is plugged into
//! (`docs/PIXEL7-USB-HANDOVER.md`).
//!
//! What the chip shares with it -- the HSI0 power domain the controller, its
//! PHY and HSI0's clock unit sit in, and the PMU's PHY isolation control --
//! the kernel would have to turn on, as `stm32mp1_usb` turns on the DK
//! board's clocks and regulators. It does not: those are power domains, and
//! writing one needs the owner's word first. ABL runs fastboot over this
//! controller until it hands over, and this module relies on it leaving them
//! on. It checks that it did, reading only: the domain says it is on, and the
//! core answers with a DWC3's identity. Otherwise the controller is left
//! alone and the boot says why.
//!
//! The node is the controller's one register window and its interrupt. Its
//! memory is not snooped (the tree gives no `dma-coherent`), so the driver
//! pins what it shares with `PIN_COHERENT`.
