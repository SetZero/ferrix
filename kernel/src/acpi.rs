//! Reaching the firmware tables from the kernel.
//!
//! `ferrix_acpi` never dereferences a pointer: it asks a [`Tables`] for bytes
//! at a physical address. This is the kernel's answer to that question, and it
//! is the only place in the tree that turns a number firmware wrote into a
//! reference the parser will read.
//!
//! Two things it refuses to do, both of which are the difference between a
//! parser that is hostile-input-safe and a kernel that is not:
//!
//! * an address outside the direct map is `None` rather than a wild read, and
//! * a length that would run past the end of the direct map is `None` too,
//!   even though the address itself is fine, and
//! * so is a range inside the direct map's span that it does not translate:
//!   the loader maps only what the memory map describes, and the RSDP's
//!   pages, so a table firmware put anywhere else would otherwise be a page
//!   fault rather than an error.
//!
//! Firmware is not an attacker, but it is software somebody else wrote and
//! shipped years ago, and the RSDP is the one pointer the kernel is handed
//! without having computed it.
