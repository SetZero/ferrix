//! The kernel's dynamic virtual address space, and the stacks built on it.
//!
//! Stage 2 of `docs/ROADMAP.md`. `mm` answers "where is this physical frame
//! readable" with the direct map, which is a constant offset and needs no
//! allocator at all. This module answers the other question — "give me a
//! *range of addresses*, and let me decide later what goes behind it" — which
//! is what a device window, a non-contiguous buffer and a guard-paged stack
//! all need and none of which the direct map can express.
//!
//! # Why the arena is a `ferrix_vma::AddressSpace`
//!
//! Because it is the same problem. A kernel arena and a process address space
//! are both a sorted set of non-overlapping ranges reshaped by insert, remove
//! and protect. `libs/vma` was written for stage 6 and is already host-tested
//! against sixty cases; using it here means stage 6 inherits an arena that has
//! been running on a real machine for four stages rather than one written the
//! week it is needed — and the bugs are found by the kernel that boots on
//! every commit, not by the first process to call `mmap`.
//!
//! What the arena cannot do on its own is remember *allocations*, only
//! *ranges*: two adjacent anonymous regions with equal permissions are merged
//! into one, which is exactly right for a process — Linux does it, and without
//! it an `mprotect` loop leaks regions — and exactly wrong for an allocator,
//! which has to hand back precisely what it handed out. So the identity of
//! each allocation lives in a second map beside the arena, keyed by the
//! address the caller holds, and the arena is left to do the thing it is good
//! at.
//!
//! # Guard pages are not decoration
//!
//! Every allocation reserves one unmapped page on each side, *inside* the
//! range the arena hands out, so the guard cannot be given to anybody else.
//! The one below a kernel stack is the reason this module exists at all: a
//! stack that overflows into the allocation beneath it corrupts unrelated
//! memory and the symptom appears somewhere else entirely, possibly much
//! later. A stack that overflows into an unmapped page takes a page fault at
//! the instruction that did it.
//!
//! The guard is *reserved* rather than *mapped without permissions* because an
//! unmapped page costs nothing — no frame, no descriptor — and faults just as
//! hard.
