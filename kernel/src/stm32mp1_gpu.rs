//! The kernel's part in an STM32MP157's GPU: its clock and its reset line,
//! then a device node a ring-3 driver is started on (`docs/GPU.md` §6.2, G1).
//!
//! The STM32MP157 carries a Vivante GC400T at `0x5900_0000`, the tree's
//! `gpu@59000000` with `compatible = "vivante,gc"`. The driver, `user/gc400`,
//! programs everything inside the core: its own clock control and soft reset,
//! its interrupt enables, and the front end that fetches command buffers.
//! What it cannot do is what the rest of the chip shares, for the reason
//! `stm32mp1` gives for the display: the RCC's clock gates and resets. So the
//! kernel does these things, once, while it publishes device nodes, and
//! nothing more:
//!
//! * checks that the GPU's core clock -- PLL2's Q output, which firmware set
//!   up and which feeds nothing but the GPU in Linux's clock tree -- is
//!   running, and says how fast;
//! * turns on the GPU's clocks: one bit of the RCC gates both the bus clock
//!   and the core clock;
//! * pulses its reset line, so the driver starts from the core's reset state
//!   whatever firmware or an earlier boot left in it.
//!
//! The RCC's offsets and bits are Linux's `drivers/clk/stm32/clk-stm32mp1.c`
//! and RM0436's register map: the gate is
//! `K_MGATE(G_GPU, RCC_AHB6ENSETR, 5, 0)`, which both `GPU` (the bus clock,
//! from `ck_axi`) and `GPU_K` (the core clock, from `pll2_q`) name; the
//! reset is `GPU_R`, 3269 in `include/dt-bindings/reset/stm32mp1-resets.h`,
//! which is the set register `0x198` times eight plus bit 5, and its clear
//! register is four bytes on (`RCC_CLR`).
//!
//! What the driver then gets is a node with one aperture, the core's
//! registers, minted a page as RM0436's memory map places it though the
//! tree's `reg` says 0x800, and its interrupt.
