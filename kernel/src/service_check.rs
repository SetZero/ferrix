//! Checks of the small services the rest of the item leans on, once the
//! scheduler runs: a registration list, a device's claim and the numbers its
//! node is published under, the boot-mode word a `reboot(2)` passes on, and
//! the sentences the interrupt table, init and the user copy layer report
//! failures with.
//!
//! Each is a handful of lines that the boot reaches only in its passing
//! shape: every hook list has room, no device is quiesced under a live
//! driver, the machines QEMU presents keep no boot mode, and nothing fails to
//! register. What they do in the other shape is what a caller relies on when
//! it happens, so it is driven here, with values of the check's own that
//! touch nothing the running machine uses -- a local list, a local set of
//! claims, a channel made for the purpose.
