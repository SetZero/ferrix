//! The boot console, drawn on the framebuffer firmware left behind.
//!
//! A machine whose serial port is out of reach shows nothing between its
//! loader and a panic. The Pixel 7 is one: its console is a RAM record read
//! back after the reset that ends a run, and until then the screen is the only
//! thing a person holding it can see. So the kernel's own console lines -- the
//! same bytes [`super::recent`] keeps, and so the same ones the log and a
//! later panic screen show -- are drawn here as they are printed. A program's
//! output is not: this is the boot console, not a terminal.
//!
//! It is asked for with `ferrix.fbcon` on the command line and is off
//! otherwise. On a machine with a cable a second copy of the log only costs
//! time, and the QEMU heads are compared against screenshots that expect them
//! as firmware left them.
//!
//! Nothing is read back and nothing scrolls, since a scroll reads the
//! framebuffer, which is a device mapping. Text runs down the screen and
//! starts again at the top, and the row after the newest line is kept blank,
//! so the newest line is the one above the gap.
//!
//! It stops for good when a panic draws its own screen over it, and when a
//! display driver takes the screen (`display::`). `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1
//! names the framebuffer as one of the kernel's two output devices; this is
//! the second use of it, write-only as the first.
