//! What the console sends, between the writer that queued it and the transmit
//! interrupt that puts it on the wire.
//!
//! # Why a ring sits between the two
//!
//! A serial port takes a byte about every 87 microseconds at 115200 baud, and
//! a writer that waits for each one waits for all of them. Before this ring
//! every write did: under the port's lock, which masks interrupts, one byte at
//! a time, polling the port for room. A 27-byte line held a processor for
//! 2.3 ms with interrupts off, and a 4 KiB write for 350 ms. On a DK1, whose
//! desktop sends every program's output to this port, a test client printing
//! a line per mouse motion kept one of the board's two cores doing nothing
//! else for as long as the mouse moved, and the compositor's frames went from
//! 11 ms to between 300 and 650.
//!
//! So a writer now copies into this ring and gives the port only what it has
//! room for at that moment; the port's transmit interrupt, which the receive
//! side already installed (`console::input`), feeds it the rest as it empties.
//! A writer that finds the ring full sleeps on [`WRITERS`] until the interrupt
//! has made room — a Linux tty blocks its writer the same way.
//!
//! # Who queues, and who still polls
//!
//! - **A task that may sleep** (`sched::may_block`), writing a program's
//!   output through `fs::terminal`: queues, and waits for room when there is
//!   none. [`write_waiting`].
//! - **Anyone else with interrupts on**, which is every `println!` from a task
//!   or a thread: queues, and polls only when the ring is full, and then only
//!   enough to make room for its own bytes. Never sleeps, because a
//!   `println!` can come from the idle task, which must not.
//! - **Interrupts masked, the transmit interrupt not installed yet, or a
//!   failure being reported**: polls everything the ring holds out first, then
//!   writes straight to the port, as every writer did before. With interrupts
//!   masked the transmit interrupt may never come to this processor, and a
//!   line printed just before the kernel stops has to be on the wire when it
//!   does.
//!
//! # Order, and whole lines
//!
//! Everything happens under `console::PORT`, and the ring is first in, first
//! out, so a program's output and the kernel's lines leave in the order they
//! were written, and a writer that writes straight to the port empties the
//! ring before it does. Boot tests read the serial log line by line and rely
//! on that. A `println!` line goes into the ring under one hold of the lock,
//! so lines from two processors do not mix, as they did not before. A task's
//! write longer than [`CHUNK`] is queued in pieces cut after a newline where
//! one falls, so the only lines another writer can come between are ones
//! longer than a chunk.
//!
//! # A transmit interrupt that stops coming
//!
//! The one way this can go wrong that polling could not: bytes queued for an
//! interrupt that never arrives are never sent, and a writer waiting for room
//! waits for ever. So a writer that finds the ring holding bytes the port has
//! not moved for a tenth of a second polls them out itself, and counts it in
//! [`stalls`]; the boot check requires the count to stay where it was.
