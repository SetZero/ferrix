//! The kernel log: every byte the console sends, kept for whoever may read it.
//!
//! # What it keeps
//!
//! The kernel's own lines ([`crate::console::println!`]) and a program's
//! output through the console (`write(2)` to a descriptor on it, which is
//! `console::write_bytes` and `console::write_raw`), in the order the port
//! sends them, as the program and the kernel wrote them: before a bare
//! newline becomes CRLF for the terminal. What it does not keep is the few
//! lines that carry the kernel's layout, which go to the port and the panic
//! screen and nowhere else: see `console::write_unlogged`.
//!
//! Two readers take it out. `syslog(2)` (`dmesg`), in the Linux personality,
//! and a ring-3 driver that holds a device whose binding may read the log --
//! the Pixel 7's USB serial port -- through a log control channel
//! (`kernel/src/logctl`, `libs/logctl`). Both are privileged: program output
//! is here, and a program's output is its own.
//!
//! # Why a ring of atomics
//!
//! As the console's recent-output ring, and for the same reasons: a byte is
//! recorded from wherever the console is written, which is interrupt handlers,
//! the idle task and a panic on a processor that may hold any lock. So a writer
//! takes no lock, allocates nothing, never waits for a reader and never wakes
//! one; readers look for new bytes on their own schedule. The storage is a
//! static array -- never the heap, which a panic cannot trust and which the
//! item's allocation argument (finding F-23) would have to count.
//!
//! One count, [`Ring::written`], says how many bytes have ever been recorded,
//! and never goes back: a byte is identified by its place in that sequence,
//! and a reader's cursor is such a place. The byte at `n` is in slot `n`
//! modulo the ring's length until byte `n + N` replaces it.
//!
//! A writer stores its byte into the slot and then claims the place with a
//! compare-and-exchange on the count, retrying at the next place if another
//! writer claimed it first. Nearly every writer holds the console's port lock,
//! so under it the ring is exact: a reader that sees the count at `n` sees
//! every byte below it. Writers that race without the lock -- a panic that
//! could not have it, or the boot check's two writers -- can leave one byte
//! stale for each such race, as the recent-output ring can. The count stays
//! exact, and nothing can leave the ring unreadable.
//!
//! # What a reader can lose
//!
//! A reader that falls more than the ring's length behind has lost what was
//! overwritten. [`Ring::read`] moves such a cursor to the oldest byte still
//! kept and says how many were skipped, and it checks again after copying:
//! a writer that went round while the copy ran turns the bytes it replaced
//! into lost ones rather than into a mix of old and new. Because a writer
//! stores before it claims, the slot of the place being claimed is always in
//! flight, so a ring of `N` slots keeps `N - 1` bytes a reader can trust.
