//! The kernel log's boot check: what a reader of the ring is promised, on
//! small rings the check owns, and what the console records, on the log itself.
//!
//! On rings of the check's own, so that the properties can be driven to their
//! edges without writing 128 KiB into the boot's log:
//!
//! * **wrap**: a ring written past its length keeps its last `N - 1` bytes,
//!   in order;
//! * **overrun**: a reader that fell behind is moved to the oldest byte kept,
//!   and told exactly how many it lost;
//! * **partial read**: a reader with less room than there is to read takes
//!   what fits, and the next read goes on from there;
//! * **unread**: what `syslog(2)`'s `SIZE_UNREAD` answers, at each of those
//!   points;
//! * **two writers at once**, on two processors when there are two, while
//!   this task reads: the count is exact, every byte read is one the writers
//!   wrote, and every byte is either read or reported lost.
//!
//! On the kernel log, that the console records what it sends and nothing
//! it was told not to: a task's write as a program's output is (without the
//! CR the port was sent), a line written the way a failure report is written
//! -- the path `console::write_panicking` takes once the panicking flag is
//! set, taken here without it -- and that a line sent with
//! `println_unlogged!` is on the port and not in the log.
