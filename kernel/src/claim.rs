//! What the cores that serve devices through a control channel share: a
//! device's claim by a driver's control channel, which a quiesce waits out,
//! and the numbers their nodes are published under, which a driver started
//! again gets back.
//!
//! # Why a quiesce waits for the claim
//!
//! A driver's death fires `devmgr`'s `TERMINATED` when its handles close,
//! which raises `PEER_CLOSED` on the core's end of the control channel but
//! does not wait for the core's task to see it. Until that task ends the
//! device is still claimed, and a driver `devmgr` starts again in the
//! meantime is refused its control channel as `InUse`. So `device_quiesce`
//! waits, bounded, for every claim whose driver end has closed -- as it
//! already did for a block ring (`block_ring::wait_until_unserved`) -- and
//! refuses only a claim a live driver still holds.
//!
//! # Why the lowest free number
//!
//! A program opens `/dev/dri/card0`, and `compositor_drm::cards` stops at
//! the first gap. A card whose driver died and came back must be `card0`
//! again, not `card1` after a hole, or nothing that looks for a screen finds
//! it.
