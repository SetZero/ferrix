//! The counterpart of `crate::acpi` for machines that describe themselves with
//! a flattened device tree: every ARMv7-A board, and AArch64 ones whose
//! firmware chooses to. `ferrix_fdt` parses a byte slice and never follows a
//! pointer; this is where that slice comes from — the loader's copy of
//! firmware's tree, read through the direct map.
//!
//! The copy is in memory the map reports as `MemKind::DeviceTree`, which
//! nothing reclaims and nothing writes, so a tree borrowed from it is
//! `'static`, honestly: stage 10 enumerates devices from the same bytes long
//! after boot.
